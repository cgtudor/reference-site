Gold dwarven outposts can also be found in the Smoking Mountains of Unther and in the Giant's Run Mountains west of the Vilhon Reach.

Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be often mistaken for white) in shades of pale lilac, silver, pink, and blue. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves. Most drow on the surface are evil and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a more neutral attitude.\n\nFeared and reviled throughout the Lands Above, the drow (or dark elves) are perhaps the most numerous, powerful, and wide-spread of the Underdark's native peoples. The majority of the dark elves live in city-states ruled by various noble Houses. Each House commands its own small army of fearless drow soldiers, cunning wizards, and zealous priestesses, as well as large contingents of slave soldiers, such as bugbears, ogres, and minotaurs. In fact, half to two-thirds of any drow city's population consists of humanoid slaves and rabble, all of whom are subject to the cruelty and whims of any passing dark elf.\n\nDark elf city-states lie below dozens of surface realms, often unbeknownst to the upperworlders who live above them. The rulers of some drow cities prefer to leave the surface races alone and turn their attention toward gaining power through the endless scheming and feuding of the noble Houses. Others, however, view the surface lands as theirs to pillage and plunder whenever they choose.\n\nDrow Racial Traits\n+2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma. These adjustments replace the high elf ability score modifiers.\n\nImmunities (Ex): A drow is immune to magic sleep spells and effects.\nRacial Bonuses: A drow has a +2 racial bonus on saves against enchantment spells and effects, a +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities, and a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks: A drow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if he were actively looking for the door.\n\nDarkvision: A drow has darkvision.\n\nSpell-Like Abilities: Darkness 1/day\n\nLight Blindness (Ex): The character suffers -1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saves, and skill checks when outside in daylight. \n\nLevel Adjustment: +1."

It was soonafter the first spell that many ex-spellcasters, or would-be spellcasters attempted to replicate.\n\nThis spell allows the caster to enact minor transmutations, possessing limitations that emphasize its role as a spell of convenience rather than an incantation of profound impact.\n\nMaintaining this spell's effects requires the caster's concentration and, should their concentration be disrupted or they attempt to cast another spell, the effect immediately ends.\n\nUpon casting this spell, the caster may select one of the following effects (only one effect may be maintained at a time.):\n\nSpark: A tiny, flickering flame forms from the end of the caster's fingertip. The flame does not burn the caster, and is far too tiny to bring harm to another creature. It is sufficient, however, to slowly warm a cup of liquid, light a candle, torch or kindle a small fire given the right materials. If a fire takes, it will continue to burn after the flame naturally dwindles on the spell's duration expires; suitable environmental conditions pertaining.\n\nCool/Warm: This spell can, to a limited degree, slowly cool or heat areas of non-magical surfaces, objects and creatures with a touch - but if such a target is too hot or cold for the caster to comfortably touch, they may be harmed in the attempt. After this spell's duration expires, or the caster stops touching the target, if its natural state is warmer or cooler than the caster has forced it to become, it will quickly return to that state.\n\nMagnify: By touching an object or creature, the caster can magnify its appearance to up to twice its size, but only to them.\n\nClean: With a touch, the caster begins to clean a small, non-magical object of dirt and muck. This effect is permanent, effectively lasting until the object becomes dirty again.\n\nShine: The caster can cause a small, non-magical object they touch to gleam as if polished. This effect is permanent; at least until the object loses its shine again.\n\nMend: The caster may mend a single minor break, bend or tear in a small, non-magical object with a touch, such as a torn piece of clothing or a bent key."

Still, the paladin really comes into her own when leading a mighty campaign against evil, not when merely looting ruins.\n\nDivine power protects the paladin and gives them their special powers. It wards off harm, protects them from disease, lets them heal themself, and guards their heart against fear.

More experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead.\n\nNOTE: Paladins must select a deity that features Paladin worshippers at character creation, as well as one Oath and one Vow at second level.

      "text": "The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious worgs. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. They know the woods as if they were their home (as indeed they are), and they know their prey in deadly detail.\n\nA ranger often accepts the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. In addition, a ranger tends to carry grudges against certain types of creatures and looks for opportunities to find and destroy them. They may adventure for all the reasons that a fighter does.\n\nA ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. Their skills allow them to survive in the wilderness, to find their prey, and to avoid detection. They also have special knowledge about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for them to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that they can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does. The worship of an appropriate deity is required for these spells to manifest and, as rangers are a divine casting class, they're expected to follow a deity's alignment restrictions.\n\nWARNING: To cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level.

Quite a few also enjoy a challenge. Figuring out how to thwart a trap or avoid an alarm is great fun for many rogues.\n\nRogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and they can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. They have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can \"fake it\" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: armor (light), weapons (rogue)\n- Skill Points: 7 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledges, Barter, Bluff, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Handle Trap, Heal, Intimidate, Open Lock, Parry, Perception, Perform, Search, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Taunt, Tumble\n- Primary Saving Throws: Reflex\n- Base Attack Bonus: + 3/4 Levels\n\n\nLevel 1: Sneak Attack I\nLevel 2: Weapon Finesse\nLevel 3: Uncanny Dodge\nLevel 4: Sneak Attack II\nLevel 5: Evasion\nLevel 6: Rogue Bonus Feat\nLevel 7: Sneak Attack III\nLevel 8: Uncanny Dodge II\nLevel 9: Rogue Bonus Feat\nLevel 10: Sneak Attack IV\nLevel 11: Improved Evasion\nLevel 12: Uncanny Dodge III, Practiced Prowess I\nLevel 13: Sneak Attack V\nLevel 14: Rogue Bonus Feat, Practiced Prowess II\nLevel 15: Hide in Plain Sight, Uncanny Dodge IV\nLevel 16: Sneak Attack IV, Practiced Prowess III\nLevel 17: Rogue Bonus Feat\nLevel 18: Fleet of Foot, Uncanny Dodge V, Sneak Attack VII, Practiced Prowess IV\n\n\nNOTE: Immunity to critical hits no longer grants immunity to Sneak Attack.

      "text": "The typical sorcerer adventures in order to improve their abilities. Only by testing their limits can they expand them. A sorcerer's power is inborn - part of their soul. Developing this power is a quest in itself for many sorcerers, regardless of how they wish to use their power. Some good sorcerers are driven by the need to prove themselves. Marked as different by their power, they seek to win a place in society and to prove themselves - and magic itself - to others. Evil sorcerers, however, also feel themselves set apart from others - apart and above. They adventure to gain power over those they look down upon.\n\nSorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don't have the background of arcane knowledge than most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons.\n\nWARNING: To cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level.

They seek knowledge, power, and the resources to conduct their studies. They may also have any of the noble or ignoble motivations that other adventurers have.\n\nThe wizard's strength is their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience, and they can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate their spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field (see School Specialization below).

Consisting mainly of halfling paladins of Arvoreen (and a few like-minded gnomes), the Marchers are highly respected by local humans and halflings alike. Both faiths take a more stern approach to duties than most others of their respective races and many community members may not appreciate them until the fighting starts. Their chapterhouse, near Barrowsmorn in the Purple Hills called Keeperstone, houses almost one hundred members, including their leader and founder Estemal Talltankard (LG male lightfoot halfling paladin/fighter of Arvoreen), whose efforts helped keep order in parts of Tethyr during its civil war. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, fighters, and rogues.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a local order based out of Western Tethyr and it would be unlikely members of this order would be spread much beyond Tethyr.

They are a far-reaching but only moderately powerful group and employ small-scale operations against evil, magic-defiling consortiums such as the Zhentarim, Twisted Rune, Red Wizards of Thay, or Sharrans.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is an uncommon order, however, it is Faerûn-wide and members could come from and travel to nearly anywhere.

They work secretly so as not to attract attention or bring about retaliation against local gnome settlements.

They can multiclass freely as clerics, fighters, illusionists, and rogues.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This quiet order of knightly gnomes will at times wander far and wide from gnome settlements and they're considered Faerûn-wide.

Well studied in tactics, they prefer to find a high vantage point in battles, observing the action until they see a group of allies in particular danger, at which point they charge in to help. Most favor training involving mobility in battle. Members of this order hold the sanctity of oath in very high regard and are known to punish oathbreakers. They can multiclass freely as clerics of Berronar, fighters, and divine champions.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is Faerûn-wide in places of dwarven populations. There are few dwarves in the Lands of Intrigue and less dwarven origins. Clan Ghalmrin under the eastern Starspire Mountains is really the only notable clan. Dwarves coming from elsewhere would be ideal, however, there should be a reason for a member of this order to want to come to a location with few dwarves to protect."

They help protect fields of crops; reclaim monster-infested farmland; serve as intermediaries between farmers and nearby nature denizens who are fearful of encroachment; and lecture, report, or even expect penance from, in severe cases, those who cross the line of balance with nature.\n\nNarrative Considerations: 1) Forcing penance would be illegal in Tethyr so it would only be strongly suggested if the farmer wishes to continue receiving the blessing of Chauntea. Silvanus followers would not likely be so gracious however should they learn of it. Chauntea's doctrine can be subjectively interpreted so there may be a variance in how it's applied; characters need not always agree. 2) Her significance to Tethyr is long-held and precious - since the importance of land-holding and agriculture stems back to the country's founding 15 centuries ago. Cultivated land (including as small as planter boxes in the city) is a symbol of status as much as wealth is to Amn. As such, Tethyr would provide a very suitable origin for a knight of this order."

She has approached his difficulty through connections made during the Tuigan War with soldiers of Impilur, specifically, those who mentioned an unusual and curious paladin order they'd heard about. This Order of the Crescent Moon is over one hundred years old but is relatively unknown outside Impiltur (where it was founded) and Tethyr (where it has very recently arrived). It is remarkable because its members are mountain-dwelling dwarves who worship Clangeddin Silverbeard and surface-dwelling humans who revere Selûne. This unusual collaboration is the result of a series of lycanthrope attacks on a human trading village in Impiltur and a nearby dwarf settlement. The humans and dwarves decided to join forces to eliminate the shapeshifter threat, and they found that the combination of Selûnite magic and dwarf battle prowess was very effective. The organization is a loose one, mainly passed down through families (now in its fourth human generation, while a few of the original dwarf founders survive), and only becomes relevant when one family is in danger and asks for help from their old allies. Zaranda, through favors and promises unknown to others, has convinced a small number of members of these families to move to Tethyr and build a new branch of the order. Its symbol is an upright hammer (part of Clangeddin's holy symbol) surrounded by seven stars (part of Selûne's symbol), which appears on armor and shields carried by dwarf and human descendants of the founders.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is only found in Impiltur and Tethyr. If a character is coming from Impiltur they would have to be a member of one of these families to arrive as a paladin. If a character isn't taking this route, they'd have to join the order within Tethyr where the skills and tools are being taught to all who seek to join the order - there are no family ties required within the Tethyr branch. The Selûnites are taught in the largest regional temple to Selûne, Moonmaiden's Hall, in Murann while the Clangeddites are taught within Clan Ghalmrin in Morndivver under the far-eastern Starspire Mountains."

They delight in the “retrieval” of things that should not be in the hands of various malevolent races or beings, such as precious metals, gemstones, crafting materials, tools, weapons, and evil magic (especially illusions). Going about these recoveries is as much about the process as it is the act itself. Traps, tricks, and misdirection are all part of the game in luring the undeserving away from these goods, and if direct physical conflict can be avoided that makes it even sweeter - though physically capable gnomes may not object to more direct means of conflict, even if they do still enjoy the amusement of deception. Items and materials collected might be donated to local gnomes or sold to recover lost supplies used to adventure.

Their members' vows to protect the innocents of Tethyr made them heroes when they began in the Year of the Long Shadows (1164 DR) during the reign of King Coram III. During the Interregnum, those same vows saw them at odds with many an opportunistic baron or bandit gang. Still, they kept their forces relatively secure throughout the two decades of unrest, and their protected followers are so grateful that any outsiders in eastern Tethyr or on the Almraiven Peninsula who speak ill of Helm (due to the Time of Troubles) may find themselves at the bad end of a brawl. This serious group of militant clergy is over 2,000 strong, its ranks filled with clerics, paladins, and fighters piously dedicated to Helm. The leader of the entire order is High Watcher Toram Gyvvalstorm, and he runs the order from its oldest holding at the fortified abbey of Chevangard in Survale Ford. The other two fortified bases for these warrior-priests are found at Velen and Saradush. Members of this order can multiclass freely as clerics and divine champions of Helm.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is considered a regional order and typical membership wouldn't extend much outside Tethyr.

Although the order is relatively young, its numbers are steadily rising as the church encourages certain members of the Companions of the One True Vision (the Helmite knightly order responsible for many native slaughters in Maztica, and thus unpopular in Faerûn even years later) to join the Vigilant Eyes. Many guilt-ridden Companions see service in the Vigilant Eyes as a way to atone for the needless deaths they caused in Maztica, and the Vigilant Eyes is developing a reputation for selflessness and humility because of the penance of some of its members. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, fighters, and divine champions.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a Faerûn-wide order and members may come from across the continent. Characters choosing to be a Companion who is now a Vigilant Eye is best to have Amn or Murann as their origin due to Helmsport/Ulatos where they were stationed being the capital of New Amn. Also, consider that the incident with the Companions occurred after The Longest Year, and travel across the ocean since then is dangerous and very uncommon."

While this order is based out of Waterdeep, each member of the Order of the Aster is assigned to a company of the Morninglord's church army. Each company is housed in one of a dozen or so church-sponsored abbeys scattered across western and central Faerûn. Companies are dispatched by the commanding abbot to battle enemies of the faith, usually in response to an entreaty from a high-ranking cleric of the Morninglord. Between tours of service, members of the order are frequently given leave to pursue their own goals. Most spend their time defending individual temples of the Morninglord, but some serve the faith by becoming adventurers. Within their own church, the paladins are frequently more conservative and concerned with the way things should be done than the clerics, who are often neutral rather than lawful. The order is dedicated to the destruction of evil undead (especially vampires); thwarting the plans of evil faiths such as Bane, Loviatar, and Talos; and defense of the clergy.

This order, currently numbering about one hundred members, is fairly old, and many famous stories told by bards actually stem from real quests performed by this order (though warped and exaggerated in the retellings over the years). Its role is to guard Milil's holy sites and do good works in Milil's name. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as fighters\n\nNarrative Considerations: Paladins of this order would be widespread across Faerûn and wouldn't have many restrictions. Arbalest's House, monastery and temple to the god Milil\non the hills north of Goldspires is, by far, the most sacred holy place in this region for the god. The mysterious Patriarch of Song (NG unknown P20 Milil) oversees it. This temple is significant for three reasons: It was Milil's place of rest during the Time of Troubles; it houses the mighty organ called the Bellows of Milil, which can be heard well out into the harbor; and Milil himself made a gate linking this temple and the bards' college of New Olamn in Waterdeep. This temple was not destroyed by the Sythillisian Horde though the gate has not been remade since The Longest Year caused it to fail. Overcoming the Horde to allow the temple to be safely accessed again may be a long-term quest for members of this order."

Hammers may serve as commanders of dwarven armies, members of elite strike forces skilled in dealing with anything from large groups of ores to great wyrms to malevolent fiends from the Lower Planes, or may choose the path of an adventurer to represent the will of a stronghold or clan to the outside world. The order is dedicated to the defense of existing dwarven holdings and dwarven communities within human settlements, as well as exploring new territory to carve out dwarven holdings. Individual chapters have a great deal of local autonomy but, in times of great crisis, a Grand Council (the reigning monarchs and senior Hammers of the affected region) assemble to plot strategy and divine Moradin's will.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is a bit of a catch-all for dwarves to play paladins with few narrative restrictions. This is a Faerûn-wide order and dwarves could come from all over the continent as members, though they may change their affiliation to the nearest stronghold if they planned to stay forever. The nearest dwarven stronghold to Murann is Clan Ghalmrin in Morndivver under the far-eastern Starspire Mountain."

A character from anywhere else would have to join the order after arriving in the area. Positions of leadership should not be expected simply by being a member and will take time and work to get into.

The order is primarily tasked with the rediscovery of ancient ceremonies, traditions, customs, and similar which have been lost over time in places where mortal descendants or ancient clergy of Siamorphe or her predecessors served various forgotten rulers. Knights may also be called to protect nobles, or even confront false nobility (only if directed by the clergy) and those who have been tempted by corruption.

Anywhere with nobility current or past may find knights of this order searching ancient ruins, castles, tombs, or otherwise for lost knowledge. The knights support those who rule in the best manner possible for the people who serve them and oppose cruel despots and corruption. They're not to be judges as to who is 'noble' and who is not, that's for the clergy. These knights should support any good leader unless directed otherwise."

Dedicated solely to Torm, its members number near seventy strong and consist of fighters and paladins, all of whom are held to a high moral standard. Patient and compassionate, yet courageous and confident, members of this order are charged with defending those unable to defend themselves and protecting those who may find themselves in harm's way. Their patron saint is Shield of Innocence, an orog paladin of Torm who gave his life to save the city of Zazesspur. The order is closely allied with Torm's church in Darromar, the five-spired temple named the Open Gauntlet, and it has many noble sponsors (including the queen), making it a wealthy order despite its size. The Loyal Order is commanded by his lordship Ellem Sunspear II (LG hm Pal9) from County Bardshyr. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as fighters.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a small Tethyr-based order and is not typically found very far outside the country. This order is brand new, being created just before the start time of the server, so all members would have recently joined. The Innocents have immediately become a member of the TDN faction, Starspire Accord, and that faction would make a suitable (though not required or expected) faction choice for a character of this order. The Innocents generally take a more defensive role compared to the Order of the Golden Lion."

Members of this order usually serve by guarding temples of other faiths that would otherwise be vulnerable or by performing quests to eliminate Banite and Cyricist strongholds and their members. The several hundred Golden Lions are easily recognized by their ornate armor and helm, which they keep polished to a golden hue. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely in any one other class besides sorcerer.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a Faerûn-wide order and members could come from any region. Members need not only go after Banites and Cyricists though they'd be a priority and this order would take a more proactive role in hunting down trouble than the Innocents. It's unlikely many PC's will end up with official temple guarding roles but protecting others of allied faiths could be seen as related."

The fortified abbey is one of the few collective temple complexes to the Triad of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. Made up of clerics, cavaliers, paladins, rangers, priests, and pious fighters of all three faiths, the Knights Kuldar have all vowed to do their best to heal the sick, help the weak, and avenge those harmed by injustice. Sometimes called the Barakmordanna among the local populace, these champions number about 2,400, the majority of whom worship Torm, though all are considered equal brethren. The group is led by a triumvirate of martial commanders, one from each faith of the Triad: Revered Father Darrom Vallson, Painbearer of Ilmater (LN hm P12 - Ilmater); Tomas Trosbann, Great Sword of Torm (LG hm Pal14); and Hammer Lord Gharek Minorson, Holy Justice of Tyr (LG hm P11 - Tyr). Each man is among the senior clergies of the temples of Barakmordin, though his primary activities are among the Knights Kuldar. This order has been a tripartite coalition since the Year of the Lean Purse (1198 DR). Paladins may multiclass freely as fighters and divine champions.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a very large Tethyr-based order, though its size may find members on missions in nearby lands, such as Erlkazar and Calimshan - most missions to Amn would be done through the Starspire Accord as they're a founding member. Similar to the Red Falcon Order and Champions Vigilant, this order is celebrated for its work to protect and save lives during the Interregnum and members would be held in high regard through Tethyr."

The Champions of Corellon formed not from ancient tradition, but from desperate necessity; elven warriors who witnessed their kin suffer during magic's absence and chose to bind themselves with rigid oaths of protection.\nThis sacrifice was profound, for it asked elvenkind to surrender the very essence of what made them free: their fluid nature, their rejection of rigid structure, their individual wandering spirits. These elven paladins embraced discipline and unwavering dedication in a way that challenged centuries of cultural identity. They swore binding vows to protect the People when the gods could not, to stand as bastions against the darkness when the Weave failed, and to preserve elven communities through strength of arms and purity of purpose.\n\nThe discipline and devotion from these militant elves often leans into zealotry, especially when compared to other Paladin orders; their absolute dedication to protecting and conserving the People's way of life make their members confrontational, assertive, and on occasion, violent.\nThe formation of this order has not been without controversy among the People. Many question whether such rigid devotion truly honors Corellon Larethian, whose very nature embodies change, freedom, and artistic expression. Some see the Champions as a necessary evolution born of hard times, while others view them as elves who have lost their way, adopting the inflexible nature of human institutions. The Champions themselves maintain that their sacrifice of personal freedom serves a greater freedom: the liberty of their people to survive and flourish.\nSince The Longest Year's end, the voice of the Seldarine remains frustratingly muted, offering no clear divine judgment on this new path. The Champions continue their work, their numbers slowly growing among those elves who have witnessed too much suffering and choose structure over chaos, protection over wandering. Whether this represents a new chapter in elven evolution or a temporary aberration born of crisis remains to be seen.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order emerged specifically from The Longest Year and would be almost exclusively found among elven communities that suffered during that time. Members would likely come from the Wealdath, Evereska, or Evermeet, though some may have formed in smaller elven enclaves across Faerûn. The internal tension between traditional elven values and paladin rigidity creates interesting roleplay opportunities, as does the uncertainty about divine approval in a world where the gods remain largely silent."

      "text": "(PRESTIGE CLASS)\nShadowdancers are rumoured to be casters with a focus on shadowy elements of magic, supposedly blended with a martial way of life. They are mysterious and unknown to most, the nature and source of their powers a debated topic in obscure circles. Rarely trusted if known and often even discriminated against in the wake of the Longest Year, they tend to conceal their powers from the common man and the worldly alike. Despite their apparent link with shadows and trickery shadowdancers are as often good as evil. Shadowdancers seldom stay in one place too long. Some use their abilities to spy. Others operate as thieves, using their abilities to infiltrate past defenses and dupe others. Some even utilize their unique abilities primarily as killers. But any true purpose behind their powers and ways - if any - remains unknown to most.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Simple weapons, light armor\n- Skill Points: 7 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledge, Barter, Bluff, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Perception, Perform, Search, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Taunt, Tumble\n- Primary Saving Throws: Reflex\n- Base Attack Bonus: + 1 Levels\n\n--- Requirements ---\n\n- Skills: Hide 8 Ranks, Move Silently 8 Ranks, Tumble 5 Ranks\n- Feats: Stealthy\n- Spellcasting: Must be able to cast 1st level arcane spells\n\n\nLevels:\n1: Touch of Shadow, Darkvision\n2: Blind Fight, Shadow Jump\n3: Shadow Daze\n4: Shadow Evade\n5: Summon Shadow\n6: Swiftened Strikes\n7: Darkened Restoration\n8: Shadowed Aggression\n9: Hide in Plain Sight\n10: Master of Shadows\n\n\nDev Note: In TDN, the Shadowdancer is effectively an Arcane spellcaster. They utilize magic in a very different way to most spellcasters, but their abilities - including Hide in Plain Sight - are all considered magical. That said, many of their abilities are not obviously magical due to a lack of visual effects or telltale signs of spellcasting such as spell components. Without extensive knowledge of what a Shadowdancer is or does, which is far from common, to say the least, many of their abilities would be extremely difficult to identify as magical in nature.\n\n\n\nTouch of Shadow: The shadowdancer's attacks deal 1 additional phantom damage. This damage increases to 2 at level 7, and 3 at level 10.\n\nShadow Evade: The shadowdancer instantly gains 15% concealment. The concealment is increased to 30% at level 7, and to 50% at level 10. This ability may be used up to three times per day. Duration is 5 rounds.\n\nShadow Jump: The shadowdancer instantly jumps through magical shadow to a location nearby, as the Dimension Door spell. Additionally they are immediately hidden from view, as the Invisibility spell but with a duration of only 1 round, and their current threat is reduced by 50%. This ability may be used once every 8 minutes. The cooldown decreases to 6 minutes at level 6, and to 4 minutes at level 10.\n\nMaster of Shadows: After using the Shadow Jump ability, the shadowdancer's attacks deal an additional 2 points of phantom damage, and each successful strike confuses the enemy for 1 round unless they succeed on a Will saving throw. The DC for this ability is 20. Duration is 5 rounds.\n\nSummon Shadow: The shadowdancer summons a shadowy after-image of himself, which acts as a lower level copy of the shadowdancer. It will copy the feats, but not the spells of the shadowdancer, deals 50% damage, and has 50% concealment. This ability may be used once every 15 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds + 1 round / class level.\n\nHide in Plain Sight: The shadowdancer instantly wraps himself in magical shadow, hiding him from sight. This ability may be used once every minute, reduced by 3 seconds per class level.\n\nShadowed Aggression: After using the Shadow Jump ability, the shadowdancer's attacks deal an additional 2 points of phantom damage. Duration is 5 rounds.\n\nSwiftened Strikes: After using the Shadow Jump ability, the shadowdancer's movements are enhanced by magical shadow as the Haste spell, but the duration is only 2 rounds.\n\nDarkened Restoration: After using the Shadow Jump ability, the shade clings to him, stitching his flesh back together with ease. Each round, he heals for 3 hit points. Duration is 2 rounds + ½ class level rounds."

      "text": "Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike sorcerers or wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. By harnessing his innate magical gift through fearsome determination and force of will, a warlock can perform feats of supernatural athletics, beguile the weak-minded, or scour his foes with blasts of eldritch power.\n\nA warlock has either made a pact (prior to The Longest Year) with a \"supernatural power\" themselves or the warlock's ancestors made the pact (I.e. it's in one's blood), and though the Longest Year has weakened planar connections, pacts remain in place, much like the connections between the divine and gods. Warlocks have not spoken directly or interacted with their patron. They, at best, communicated with some inconsequential underling that served as a messenger or just performed a ritual that struck the pact.\n\nNOTE: This class is universally treated as an undesirable and generally is likely to struggle within the setting of TDN. As such Warlock isn't recommended for new players or those that shy from hardship, confrontation, and conflict in storytelling. This class is considered permanently Opt-In from character creation.\n\n- Class Restriction: Warlocks may not multiclass with Divine Spellcasters.\n- Alignment Restriction: Any Evil or Chaotic Neutral\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Armor (light): A Warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Weapons (Simple).\n- Skill Points: 3 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: Barter, Bluff, Diplomacy, Concentration, Decipher Script, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge(all), Perform, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt and Use Magic Device\n- Primary Saving Throws: Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +3/4 Level\n\nInvocations (Spellcasting): A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. In order to cast an invocation a warlock must have a base charisma of 10 + the invocation tier. (ex: In order to cast Dark invocations, a warlock needs 14 charisma). A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following qualifications:\n\nA warlock's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock's invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifically states otherwise. A warlock's caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level.\n\nThe save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock's Charisma modifier. Spell-like abilities are not actually spells, but a warlock can benefit from spell feats as if they were. For the purposes of spell focus and immunities, eldrich blast is an evocation spell. The invocations that mimic spells function as the same school as the spell they mimic.\n\nA warlock can use metamagic on invocations in the same way that a sorcerer can use metamagic for their spells. Metamagic is used in the same way a spontaneous caster can utilize metamagic.\n\nSimilar to a sorcerer, a warlock can change their invocations known while leveling up.\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Eldritch Blast 1d6\n2: Eldritch Lore\n3: Eldritch Blast 2d6\n4: Damage Reduction I\n5: Deceive Item\n6: Eldritch Blast 3d6\n7: Fiendish Resilience I\n8: Damage Reduction II\n9: Eldritch Blast 4d6\n10: Energy Resistance 5\n11: Fiendish Resilience II\n12: Eldritch Blast 5d6, Armored Caster\n13: Damage Reduction III\n15: Eldritch Blast 6d6\n17: Damage Reduction IV\n18: Fiendish Resilience III, Eldritch Blast 7d6, Energy Resistance 10\n\nEldritch Blast: The warlock gains this spell as a cantrip that may be cast an infinite number of times per day. It deals 1d6 points of magic damage on a successful ranged touch attack. The caster level of this spell is equal to 1/2 class level (rounded down). Metamagic feats may not be used to modify this spell. The damage of this spell increases to 2d6 at level 3, 3d6 at level 6, 4d6 at level 9, 5d6 at level 12, 6d6 at level 15, and 7d6 at level 18.\n\nEldritch Lore: The warlock gains a +2 bonus to Knowledge (Arcane) and Spellcraft skill checks.\n\nDamage Reduction: Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, the warlock gains DR 1/+2. This increases to 2/+2 at level 8, 3/+2 at level 13, and 4/+2 at level 17.\n\nDeceive Item: The warlock gains a +4 bonus to Use Magic Device skill checks.\n\nFiendish Resilience: The warlock taps into his reservoirs of dark magic to regenerate his body. Each round, he heals for 1 hit point. The amount healed increases to 2 hit points at level 11, and 3 hit points at level 18. This ability may be used once per day. Duration is 20 rounds.\n\nArmored Caster: The warlock receives -30% arcane spell failure\n\nEnergy Resistance: The warlock gains resistance 5 against two energy types of his choice at level 5 This increases to resistance 10 at level 18."

      "text": "The favored soul follows the path of the cleric but is able to channel divine power with surprising ease. She is able to perform the same tasks as her fellow divine spellcasters but with virtually no study; to her, it comes naturally. Scholars wonder if favored souls have traces of outsider blood from unions, holy or unholy, centuries ago and generations removed. Others suggest that divine training of the proper type awakens the ability, or that favored souls are simply imbued with their gifts by their gods when they begin the cleric's path. In any case, favored souls cast their spells naturally, as much through force of personality as through study. Though this gives them extraordinary divine abilities no normal person could ever match, they see their gift as a call to action, and so in some ways may lag behind their more studious colleagues.\n\nFavored Souls are often loners, wandering the land serving their deities. They are sometimes welcomed by their churches but treated as unusual and are commonly misunderstood. They often believe themselves to be emissaries of their deities and thus often are outside the church's command structure - respected mystics not requiring the support normally crucial to a priest's success, but few share this view. This makes them sometimes revered by the naive, and sometimes hated by their Cleric counterparts. While Favored Souls are commonly disrespected for their perceived lack of discipline, there are those that readily accept them into their fold.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None*\n*Favored Souls must select an Alignment within one-step of their deity's alignment. Additionally, Favored Souls will need to follow their deity's dogma.\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Favored souls are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A favored soul is also proficient with her deity's favored weapon. Although a favored soul is not proficient with heavy armor, wearing it does not interfere with her spellcasting.\n- Skill Points: 3 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge: All, Parry, Perform, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude, Reflex, Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +3/4 Levels\n- Spellcasting: Divine (spell failure from armor is ignored), Charisma-based (a base Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level is required to cast a spell, bonus spells are based on modified Charisma, and the Charisma modifier affects spell DCs), and requires preparation.

Her weapon deals an additional 1 divine damage at level 3. The additional damage increases to 2 at level 7, 3 at level 12, and 4 at level 17.\n\nEnergy Resistance: The favored soul gains resistance 10 against an energy type of their choice at level 5. She gains resistance 10 against a second type at level 10, and a third type at level 15.\n\nDeity's Improved Critical: The favored soul gains the Improved Critical feat with her deity's favored weapon at level 9.\n\nDeity's Weapon Specialization: The favored soul gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity's favored weapon at level 13.\n\nBlessing of the Chosen: At 18th level, the favored soul is protected by their deity. When her hit point total falls below 25% of its maximum value, she instantly receives 60 temporary hit points, a +4 bonus to all ability scores and DR 10/+3 for 3 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier. This ability can only trigger once every two hours."

      "text": "Masters of the spirit realm, the Shaman follows a different divine tradition than the cleric or the druid. Shamans perceive a world that no other truly understands, a world filled with powerful, living spirits, some helpful and some malign. As such, they feel it is their duty to advise their comrades and protect them from the wrath of the spirits. By bargaining with powerful spirits, the shaman gains power over the natural world and mighty divine magic with which to aid her comrades or smite her enemies.\n\nShamans exist to mediate between the human world and the spirit world and make sure that humans (and dwarves, elves, orcs, and all other humanoid races, of course) respect the spirits as is only right and proper. Shamans adventure to advance the causes of whichever spirits they favor. Those who venerate helpful spirits seek to assist people deserving of the spirits' protection. Those who revere dark and vengeful spirits promote the chaos and suffering in which their patrons delight. Through their actions, Shamans prove the power of the patron spirits and earn prestige and status in the spirit world.\n\nShamans cast divine spells much the same way druids do, though they do not receive spells directly from deities. The typical Shaman pursues a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devoting themselves to a divine entity. When a Shaman meditates to regain their daily allotment of spells, they send forth their Spirit Sight to bargain with the spirits and retrieve knowledge of the specific druid spells they will be able to use that day. These spirits act as intermediaries between the shaman and powerful patrons of the natural world including primal spirits, primordials, and archfey who are the sources of the divine magic. Their spells, like the druid's, are oriented toward nature and animals. In addition to spells, Shamans gain an increasing array of spiritual powers as they advance in level.\n\n- Alignment: None.\n- Hit Die: d8.\n- Proficiencies:  armor (light, medium), shields, weapons (druid).\n- Skill Points: 5 + Int modifier.\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +3/4 levels\n- Skills: Animal Empathy, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Diplomacy, Decipher Script, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge: All, Perception, Perform, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt\n- Spellcasting: Divine (spell failure from armor is ignored), wisdom-based (a base wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level is required to cast a spell, bonus spells are based on modified wisdom, and the wisdom modifier affects spell DCs), and spontaneous cast (no spell preparation required). A Shaman casts spells which are drawn from the druid spell list.\nLike a sorcerer, a Shaman knows only a small number of spells. When a Shaman meditates to regain her daily allotment of spells she sends forth her Spirit Sight to bargain with the spirits and retrieve knowledge of the specific druid spells she will be able to use that day.\n- Patron Spirits: A Shaman's patron can be any nature, fey, elemental or primordial deity.\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Spirit Sight\n2: Shaman Path, Path Feat\n4: Ancestor Chant I\n6: Path Feat\n7: Woodland Stride\n9: Rot Immunity\n10: Ancestor Chant II\n11: Path Feat\n13: Purge the Soul\n15: Ancestor Chant III\n16: Path Feat\n18: Favored of the Spirits\n\nShamans receive unlimited damage-dealing cantrips.\n\nSpirit Sight: The shaman momentarily sees through the eyes of nearby spirits, as the See Invisibility spell. This ability may be used once per day. Duration is 1 round per class level.\n\nAncestor Chant: The shaman makes a plea for the spirits' aid through ritual song and dance in a 10-meter radius, becoming unable to move or take another action during the duration of this ability. They grant nearby allies a +1 enhancement bonus against undead & outsiders, a +2 bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting abilities, and allow them to regenerate 2 hit points each round. These bonuses increase to +2 enhancement bonus, +4 to saving throws, and +4 regeneration at level 10; and to +3, +6, and +6 at level 15. This ability may be used once every 30 minutes. Duration is 5 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier.\nRot Immunity: The shaman gains immunity to disease.\nPurge the Soul: The Shaman purges the target's soul of any uncleanliness, as the Restoration spell. This ability may be used once every hour.\nFavored of the Spirits: The Shaman can call the aid of a spirit to protect himself or another ally. Should the affected creature's hit points be reduced to 0 or less, the spirit comes to their aid, as the Heal spell. This ability may be used once every two hours. Duration is 5 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier.\n\nShaman Paths:\n\n    Animism\n        Level 2 - Spirit Ward: The shaman wards his companions against dark forces in a 5-meter radius. Nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against disease, poison, negative energy, and death effects.

      "text": "Hexblades are former or current disciples of Beshaba, specially trained in a unique but highly secretive form of magic which was purportedly crafted by the Maid of Misrule Herself. The strange twisting of the Weave is tailored by Beshaba - so it is theorised by arcane scholars - to take advantage of Her own portfolio, and it is said that these Hexblades undergo rituals that curse themselves to become living conduits of misfortune.\n\nMany are the tales of these warrior-mages and the rumours of the woes that surround them like an acrid mist. The life of a Hexblade is fraught with suspicion, distrust and even outright hate from most that know them. When famine, plague or a simple string of unfortunate events break out, any nearby Hexblade is likely to be accused as the cause. They are harbingers of gloom, an ill omen, and are often found wherever things are at their worst.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: Any non-good. A Hexblade who becomes good-aligned loses the ability to use all Hexblade class abilities. He may not progress any farther in levels as a Hexblade. He retains all the other benefits of the class (weapon and armor proficiencies and bonus feats).\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Hexblades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A Hexblade does not incur any spell failure for the use of any of his abilities.\n- Skill Points: 3 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Discipline, Diplomacy, Decipher Script, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge: All, Perception, Perform, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble and Use Magic Device\n- Primary Saving Throws: Reflex & Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +1 / Level\nNote: All Hexblade abilities are considered arcane, and thus makes them ineligible for multiclassing with classes like Artificer and Palestone Knight.\n\n\nLevel\n1: Arcane Defense (Enchantment)\n2: Hexblade's Curse\n3: Bonus Feat (Hex Strike)\n4: Absorb Spell I (2x/day)\n5: Arcane Defense (Transmutation)\n7: Shroud of Misfortune I\n8: Absorb Spell II (4x/day)\n9: Arcane Defense (Evocation)\n10: Bonus Feat (Hex Strike)\n12: Shroud of Misfortune II\n13: Bonus Feat (Hex Strike)\n15: Arcane Defense (Necromancy)\n16: Absorb Spell III (6x/day)\n17: Bonus Feat (Hex Strike)\n18: Blade of Woe\n\nArcane Defense: The hexblade receives the Arcane Defense (Enchantment) feat at level 1. He receives the Arcane Defense (Transmutation) feat at level 5, the Arcane Defense (Evocation) feat at level 9, and the Arcane Defense (Necromancy) feat at level 15.\n\nHexblade's Curse: The hexblade may apply a curse to their weapon for 10 minutes per class level which grants it a 50% chance with each successful strike to curse the struck enemy, acting as the Doom spell. The DC for this effect changes based on the Hexblade’s level.\n\nHex Strike: The Hexblade gains Hex Strikes as bonus feats. A successful strike with a Hex Strike applies an effect to the hexblade, depending on which Hex Strike was used. Duration is 4 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier. Note that, on a missed attack, the Hex Strike is lost and may not be used again until it refreshes. These abilities may only be used once every 3 minutes, and each have their own individual cooldown:\n\n    Disintegrating: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 acid damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 acid damage and casts Acid Splash on each subsequent successful strike.\n    Blazing: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 fire damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 fire damage and casts Flare on each subsequent successful strike.\n    Shocking: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 electrical damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 electrical damage and casts Electric Jolt on each subsequent successful strike.\n    Languid: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 cold damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 cold damage and has a 75% chance to cast Slow with a DC of 18 and a duration of 1 round on each subsequent successful strike. Requires level 10.\n    Corrupting: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 negative damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 negative damage and deals 1d2 constitution damage on each subsequent successful strike unless the enemy succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw. The DC for this save is 18. Requires level 10.\n    Booming: The hexblade's next attack deals an additional 1d8 sonic damage. On a successful strike, the hexblade’s weapon is imbued with 2 sonic damage and has a 75% chance to cast Deafness with a DC of 18 and a duration of 1 round on each subsequent successful strike. Requires level 10.\n\n\nAbsorb Spell: The Hexblade gains the ability to grant themselves a shield that absorbs a single spell of up to 1st level at level 4 and may be used twice per day. The shield becomes stronger as the hexblade grows more powerful, absorbing up to level 2 spells and usable four times per day at level 8; and stronger again, absorbing up to level 4 spells and usable six times per day at level 16. Duration is 1 round + 1 round/ CHA modifier.\n\nShroud of Misfortune: The Hexblade can conjure a magic veil around themselves that distorts their enemy's perception of them. This grants them 30% concealment at level 7. The concealment increases to 40% at level 12. Duration is 2 rounds + 1 round per 6 class levels. This ability may be used once every 10 minutes.\n\nBlade of Woe: The hexblade's next attack inflicts the following effects: Disease (Zombie Creep), Poison (1d2 intelligence damage), and Wounding unless the enemy succeeds on saving throws against the effects. The DC for each of these effects is 20. Additionally, on successful strike, the Hexblade's weapon will also be imbued with vampiric regeneration +3. The duration of this effect is 4 rounds + 1 / CHA modifier. This ability may be used once every 12 minutes\n\n"

      "text": "The swashbuckler embodies the concepts of daring and panache. Favoring agility and wit over brute force, the swashbuckler excels both in combat situations and social interactions, making her a versatile character indeed.\n\nSwashbucklers adventure for a variety of motivations, based on their alignment and background. Some seek to right injustices, while others seek only fame and fortune. All swashbucklers, however, share a tendency to leap into action when the call comes, regardless of their personal views.\n\nThe swashbuckler combines skill and finesse with sheer combat prowess. Though swashbucklers can't dish out quite as much damage as a typical fighter or barbarian, they tend to be more agile and mobile than most melee combatants. When she can pick her battles carefully, a swashbuckler becomes a very deadly opponent (not to mention hard to pin down). Swashbucklers also hold their own in social situations, unlike most fighters.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None\n- Hit Die: d10\n- Proficiencies: Swashbucklers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor. Some of the swashbuckler's class features, as noted below, rely on her being no more than lightly armored.\n- Skill Points: 5 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Decipher Script, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, All Knowledges, Perform, Sense Motive, Taunt, Tumble.\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Reflex\n- Base Attack Bonus: +1 / Level\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Lightning Reflexes\n2: Weapon Finesse, Uncanny Dodge I\n3: Precise Strike\n4: Opportune Parry and Riposte\n5: Opportunist, Evasion\n6: Uncanny Dodge II\n7: Mobility, Acrobatic Charge I\n8: Guile, Opportune Parry, Riposte II\n9: Improved Initiative\n10: Uncanny Dodge III, Acrobatic Charge II\n11: Improved Evasion\n12: Opportune Parry, Riposte III\n13: Spring Attack, Acorbatic Charge III\n14: Uncanny Dodge IV, Bewildering Flurry I\n15: Slippery Mind\n16: Opportune Parry, Riposte IV, Uncanny Dodge V\n17: Defensive Roll, Acrobatic Charge IV\n18: Bewildering Flurry II\n\n\n    Precise Strike: The swashbuckler dances nimbly around opponents' defenses and strikes unguarded areas with unpredictable blows. They gain a bonus on their melee attacks with light main-hand weapons, as well as any main-hand weapon that is affected by the Weapon Finesse feat, equal to their Dexterity bonus, up to a maximum of ? of their class level (rounded down). This ability may not be used while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while using a shield.\n    Opportune Parry and Riposte: The swashbuckler instantly readies their blade to counterattack. She gains a bonus to their armor class equal to ¼ of their level against the next attack targeting them. If this strike is unsuccessful, the swashbuckler may immediately make an attack of opportunity against the attacker. The number of uses of this ability increases by one at level 8, 12, and 16, up to a maximum of four uses every 3 rounds. One use of this ability refreshes every 3 rounds. This ability has no effect if used while already active. This ability may not be used while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while using a shield.\n    Guile: The swashbuckler combines wit with skill when dueling opponents. She gains a dodge bonus to armor class equal to ? of the swashbuckler's level (rounding down). This ability may not be used while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while using a shield.\n    Acrobatic Charge: The swashbuckler increases their movement speed by 50% and becomes impossible to tie down, as the Freedom of Movement spell. This ability may be used once every 16 minutes. The cooldown is reduced to 12 minutes at level 10, 8 minutes at level 13, and 5 minutes at level 17. Duration is 1 round. This ability may not be used while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while using a shield.\n    Bewildering Flurry: The swashbuckler applies the Keen property to her main-hand weapon, and gains an additional attack per round. However, they suffer -4 strength and dexterity after this effect ends. This ability may be used once ever 20 minutes. The cooldown decreases to 10 minutes at level 18. Duration for both the positive and negative effects is 3 rounds. This ability may not be used while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while using a shield.\n"

      "text": "A specialist wizard who calls himself a necromancer or a cleric with the Death domain has significant power over undead and the forces of negative energy, but a dread necromancer is their true master. A practitioner of vile and forbidden arts, the dread necromancer roots about in graveyards, searching out moldering components for her obscene spells. She calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the dead, seeking their arcane secrets. She might be a consummate villain, or perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along questionable moral paths\n\n- Alignment Restriction: Any Evil.\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Simple and Martial weapons, Light and Medium armor. Shields.\n- Skill Points: 3 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Hide, Intimidate, Knowledge (all), Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt, and Use Magic Device.\n- Primary Saving Throws: Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +3/4 Levels\n- Spellcasting: A dread necromancer casts arcane spells (spell failure from armor is ignored), which are drawn from the dread necromancer's spell list. Like a sorcerer, she can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. When a dread necromancer gains access to a new level of spells, she automatically knows all the spells for that level given on the dread necromancer's spell list. Dread necromancers also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below).\nTo cast a spell, a dread necromancer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a dread necromancer's spell is 10 + the spell's level + her Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a dread necromancer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given in Table: The Dread Necromancer. In addition, she receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score.\n\n- In order to fulfill various Ability requirements, specific abilities must be used in order to keep the Dread Necromancer on their vile path. See Abilities denoted by: \"Unique Conflict/Abilities\" below.\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Charnel Touch, Rebuke Undead\n2: Necromantic Body\n3: Necromantic Burst 1/day\n4: Advanced Learning, Mental Bastion +2\n5: Dread\n8: Advanced Learning, Necromantic Burst 2/day, Undead Mastery\n9: Negative Energy Resistance\n10: Light Fortification 25%\n11: Scabrous Touch 2/day\n12: Advanced Learning, Enervating Touch\n13: Necromantic Burst 3/day\n14: Mental Bastion +$\n16: Advanced Learning, Scabrous Touch 3/day\n17: Enervating Touch, Light Fortification 50%\n18: Necromantic Burst 4/day, Shroud of Undeath\n\n- Charnel Touch: Negative energy flows through a dread necromancer's body, concentrating in her hands. At will, but no more than once per round, she can make a melee touch attack against a living foe that deals 1d8 points of damage +1 for every class level. This damage increases by 1d4 for every 3 caster levels beyond first. This is a Melee touch attack and a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifier) reduces damage by half.This ability can be used to heal undead for 1 for every class level. Unlimited uses/day.\n\nUnique/Conflict Abilities:\n1) \"Trap Soul\" - Targetted Living Body is marked for use by the Necromancer after the living creature dies.\n2) \"Dread Gravesite\" - The Dread Necromancer infuses a stored soul of a post-mortem creature into the targeted location. (This action is required for use of the \"Necromantic Body\" passive ability below.)\nIf a player (that is not a Dread Necromancer) should come within 6 meters of the site, the Soul is reanimated. (Summons a skeleton).\nCannot be done inside Non-Natural Interior Areas.\n3) \"Deathly Reawakening\" - The Dread Necromancer immediately awakens all marked Dread Gravesites.\nNote: Reawakened Skeletons are not controlled by Dread Necro. They would be viewed as Hostile.\nNote: All Undead summoned in the above ways are \"Hostile\" to everyone.\n\n- Rebuke Undead (Su):A dread necromancer can rebuke or command undead creatures (as an evil cleric) by channeling negative energy through her body. See the cleric class feature.\nA Dread Necromancer cannot use this ability to benefit from Divine Might or Divine Shield\n- Necromantic Body:Starting at 2nd level gains 2% resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing for every class level.\nPer-every-other-level, the Dread Necromancer must have created a Dread Gravesite within the last 24 hours. (I.e. At level 10, to qualify for the 20% resistance, the Dread Necromancer will have needed to create 5 Dread Gravesites within the last 24 hours.)\n- Necromantic Burst (Su):Beginning at 3rd level, a dread necromancer gains the ability to emit a burst of negative energy from her body, harming living creatures within 5 feet of her. This burst deals 1d4 points of damage per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifier) reduces damage by half. Undead creatures within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures. A dread necromancer can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every five levels she attains beyond 3rd (2/day at 8th level, 3/day at 13th level, and 4/day at 18th level).\nThe Dread Necromancer needs to have completed a \"Deathly Reawakening\" within the last 24 hours in order to use this ability.\n- Advanced Learning (Ex): At 4th level, a dread necromancer can add a new spell to her list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a cleric or wizard spell of the necromancy school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the dread necromancer already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that dread necromancer's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell she knows. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a dread necromancer. A dread necromancer gains an additional new spell at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level. Similar to a wizard this ability is completed by being used on a scroll of the chosen spell.\n- Mental Bastion: Starting at 4th level, a dread necromancer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist sleep, stunning, paralysis, poison, or disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 14th level.\n- Dread (Su): Beginning at 5th level, a dread necromancer can fill nearby creatures with dread. Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken (–2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.). A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected by that dread necromancer's fear aura for 24 hours.\n- Scabrous Touch: Starting at 6th level, once per day a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches. This ability works like the contagion spell, inflicting the disease of her choice immediately, with no incubation period, unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier). The DC for subsequent saving throws to resist the effects of the disease depends on the disease inflicted; see Disease for details.\n- Undead Mastery:All undead creatures created by a dread necromancer who has reached 8th level or higher gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and the hit dice of summoned undead are raised to that of the Dread Necromancer.\nIn addition, when a dread necromancer uses spells to summon and create undead, she can control 1/2 her Charisma bonus (rounded down) worth of undead creatures at the same time.\nSimilarly, when a dread necromancer casts the control undead spell, the spell targets up to (2 + her Cha bonus) HD/level of undead creatures, rather than the 2 HD/level normally granted by the spell.\nNegative Energy Resistance: Beginning at 9th level, a dread necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist negative energy effects, including energy drain, some ability drain, death and inflict spells.\n- Light Fortification: Starting at 10th level, a dread necromancer gains 25% fortification; this is the equivalent of the light fortification armor special ability. At 17th level, this fortification increases to 50%. On The Dragon's Neck, players cannot be critically hit by NPCs, this ability still functions for anything else that could potentially critically hit the Dread Necromancer. Fortification is a chance for a critical hit to instead be a normal hit.\n- Enervating Touch (Su): When a dread necromancer reaches 12th level, she gains the ability to bestow negative levels when she uses her charnel touch attack. There is a second saving throw for this negative level.\n- Shroud of Undeath(Su):While the secrets of lichdom have been lost due to the time of troubles, those devoted to achieving undeath strive for alternatives. At level 18 a dread necromancer can shroud their form with necromantic energy in an attempt to emulate the traits of powerful undead. The effects of this shroud are permanent until turned off, or another form is taken. While in any shroud you are healed by negative energy, but are only healed 50% from all other sources. In addition each form has unique benefits, These enhancement bonuses stack with the other bonuses gained from class abilities, but do not stack with other enhancement effects such as protection from alignment or the endurance spell.\nShroud of the Zombie: While in this form you gain +6 enhancement bonus to constitution. You gain Damage Reduction 10/- for bludgeoning and piercing damage. In addition you gain a +4 bonus to saves against Mind-affecting, paralysis, poison and disease. Your move speed is slowed by 20% due to your now shambling pace.\n\tShroud of the Vampire: While in this form you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to strength and charisma in addition to a +4 bonus to reflex saves. All threat generated is reduced by 20%. You gain a 20% bonus to move speed. Vampiric regeneration 3. You are sensitive to light, and will take 1d4 damage per round while outside during the day and you will also suffer double damage from divine and light-based damage.\n\tShroud of the Wraith: This form grants you 50% concealment, an aura of unnatural. Damage reduction 20/+1. While in this form you cannot wield any items in your hands, but can still cast spells and abilities.\n\tShroud of the Lich: While in this form you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to intelligence and wisdom and charisma but you suffer a -4 penalty to strength dexterity and constitution. While in this from your spells and abilities are cast as if your caster level is 1 higher."

They are believed to have been touched by the dwarven gods of battle, who taught them that if they die in battle, they will return to Faerûn stronger than before as a just reward. Therefore, they have no fear of death. They are given to drinking, rowdy and boisterous singing, and drunken dancing. Battleragers command grudging, if fearful, respect within dwarven society, where they are known to have coined such philosophically complex dwarven maxims like \"head first\" and \"if it moves, kill it.\" Most live short, glorious lives.\n\nWhile enraged, a battlerager's face becomes distorted and twisted. His teeth grind together as spittle flies from his mouth and dribbles down his beard. His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become bloodshot. Charging into battle, he bellows forth his clan or holy war song, throwing his hammers and axes all the way, before cleaving his foes with his mighty dwarven waraxe. In short, he becomes almost unstoppable. Battleragers are often covered from head to toe in body art, from tattoos to brands to ritual scars.

      "text": "(PRESTIGE CLASS)\nDragon Devotees are born from intense curiosity and ambition for power, attracting those who are obsessed with not the beauty and majesty of dragons but their legendary power and indomitable resilience. They will stop at nothing to emulate such power through means that are so abhorrent and perilous that the mere mention of them would encourage most mortals to question the very sanity of the individual through whose lips those words passed. A devotee’s journey is not one forged from inheritance or birthright; however. Rather, it is a path beginning with a sorcerous lineage that merely hints at an ancient connection to draconic forces - perhaps due to a long-forgotten oath or geas to a dragon an ancestor of theirs took many generations ago, or a similarly distant and tenuous connection.\n\nDelving into forbidden, and most likely illegal, alchemical practices, a true devotee subjects themselves to brutal self-experimentation, ingesting concoctions that no sane alchemist would dare touch and repeatedly exposing themselves to near-deadly amounts of their draconic element. The substances they use are of such volatile potency that they provoke severe and unsightly mutations, permanently warping their flesh. Their skin becomes a tapestry to their obsession, irreversibly scarred by blisters and tumors that harden over time. These physical changes may well grant them the elemental resilience of dragons, in addition to enhanced physical ability and an unnerving aura, but at the cost of their former appearance. Their new visage is hideous and twisted, and they must suffer perpetual pain which serves as a reminder of what their ravenous lust for power has cost them. The process is more of a ritual than it is a transformation, each step further alienating them from their humanity until it is nothing more than a faint whisper in their addled mind, infested with only thoughts of their depraved experiments.\n\nNOTE: This class is universally treated as undesirable due to both their grotesque appearance and twisted practices. It is generally likely to struggle within the setting of TDN, especially upon the acquisition of Natural Armor. What this inherently entails is a greater likelihood of permadeath. As such, Dragon Devotee isn't recommended for new players or those who shy from hardship, confrontation, and conflict in storytelling.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: No additional proficiency in any weapon or armor.\n- Skill Points: 5 + int modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledges, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, Listen, Perform, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: + 1 Levels\n\n--- Requirements ---\n\n- Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 11 ranks\n- Languages: Draconic.\n- Spellcasting: Requires at least 3 levels in sorcerer with the draconic bloodline\n\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevels:\n1: Draconic Resistance\n2: Bonus Feat, Ability Increase (+2 CHA)\n3: Ability Increase (+2 CON), Natural Armor\n4: Bonus Feat\n5: Ability Increase (+2 STR), Ignore Spell Failure (20%)\n\nSpellcasting: The dragon devotee gains new spells per day as if they had also gained a level in sorcerer at level 1 and level 4.. They do not learn new spells at these levels.\n\nDraconic Resistance: Blisters immediately begin to form on the dragon devotee's skin due to the alchemical mixtures they religiously apply to it. Though soft, the blisters offer elemental protection. They gain the Resist Energy feat to match their draconic bloodline.\n\nAbility Increase: The devotee's demented self-experiments further their abilities. Their Charisma score is permanently increased by 2 points as their mere presence becomes tangibly alarming at level 2. Their Constitution score is permanently increased by 2 points as the devotee develops increased pain tolerance from their self-mutilation at level 3. Their Strength score is permanently increased by 2 points as their experiments finally bear abhorrent fruit in drawing out preternatural might at level 5.\n\nBonus Feat: The devotee's obsession fuels the frantic pursuit of knowledge. The are granted bonus feats at level 2 and level 4.\n\nNatural Armor: Through repeated experimentation, the blisters covering the dragon devotee's skin harden into horrifying tumors, acquiring a toughness akin to bone. They gain protection against physical attacks in addition to their elemental resistance, providing a +1 natural AC bonus.\n\nIgnore Spell Failure: The dragon devotee embraces what to most would be considered insanity, and their body becomes accustomed to self-inflicted pain and hardship. This disturbing detachment from reality in both body and mind allows them to ignore the weight and discomfort of some armor while performing the components of their spells. They gain a 20% reduction in arcane spell failure."

      "text": "While the most classic example of a warden is something akin to a paladin that has not so wholly devoted themselves to a god or divine cause, there are many ways in which wardens can differ. A warden can be a cunning strategist who knows the power of confident words that boost the morale of their soldiers, or they can be a ruthless tyrant who uses their intimidating presence to bully minions into fighting harder out of the fear of displeasing them.\n\nA warden’s words are in many ways the most powerful tool in their possession, as long as they have allies at their side. By no means, though, does this mean that a warden is defenseless without their companions. To the contrary, their experience in war is exactly what affords them their air of calm in the face of great danger.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None\n- Hit Die: d12\n- Proficiencies: A warden is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).\n- Skill Points: 5 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledges, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Trap, Decipher Script, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, Perform, Sense Motive, Taunt, Tumble\n- Primary Saving Throws: Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: +1 / Level\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Luck of Heroes\n2: Hold the Line I\n4: Cut them Down I\n5: Break their Spirits I\n6: Gather Courage I, Regal Bearing\n7: Selfless Ward\n8: Show No Fear\n9: Hold the Line II\n10: Bonus Feat (Overpower or Shield Wall)\n11: Cut them Down II\n12: Break their Spirits II\n13: Gather Courage II\n15: Hold the Line III\n16: Gather Courage III\n17: Cut them Down III\n18: Break their Spirits III, Defiant Cry\n\nHold the Line: The warden grants nearby allies, other than himself, a +1 bonus to armor class. This bonus increases to +2 at level 9, and +3 at level 15. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes. Duration is 5 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier.\n\nCut Them Down: The warden grants nearby allies, other than himself, a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. These bonuses increase to +2 at level 11, and +3 at level 17. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes. Duration is 5 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier.\n\nBreak Their Spirits: The warden attempts to demoralize nearby enemies, inflicting a penalty of -1 to armor class unless they succeed on a Will saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is 14 + CHA modifier. The penalty increases to -2 at level 12, and to -3 at level 18. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds.\n\nGather Courage: The warden bolsters themselves to lead by example. They gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and armor class. These bonuses increase to +2 at level 13, and to +3 at level 16. This ability may be used once every 5 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds + ½ CHA modifier (rounded down).\n\nRegal Bearing: The warden’s experience affords them a commanding demeanor. They gain a +2 bonus to Barter, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks.\n\nSelfless Ward: The warden sets their protective gaze upon a nearby ally. While the Warden and the warded ally remain within 10 meters of each other, 40% of all physical damage dealt to the warded ally is dealt to the warden instead. The warden may take damage that would reduce their remaining hit points below 0 from this damage. This ability may be used at will and lasts until canceled.\n\nShow No Fear: The warden removes fear effects from nearby allies in a 30-meter radius. Additionally, they gain immunity to fear effects. This ability may be used three times per day. Duration is 3 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier.\n\nOverpower: While wielding a two-handed weapon, the warden gains a +1 dodge bonus to armor class per 6 class levels (rounded down),\n\nShield Wall: While wielding a shield, the warden has a 5% chance to gain 10% physical damage immunity every time they are struck. While their current hit point total is below 50% of their maximum hit point total, the chance increases to 25%. Duration of the immunity is 1 round + 1 round per 6 class levels.\n\nDefiant Cry: The Warden bellows aloud their defiance, granting nearby allies 3d20 temporary hit points. This ability may be used once per hour. Duration is 2 rounds + 1 round / CHA modifier."

      "text": "Pioneers of a brave new world, artificers are the mad brain-children of gnomish engineering and dwarven craftsmanship, refined by human ingenuity. The technology artificers use was hastened into creation by the onset of the Longest Year, as dwarves and gnomes combined forces to pursue solutions to the possibility of a world without magic. Though their machinations have manifested in many ways, artificers in particular have studied ways to weaponize this strange new science.\n\nBecause it is such a new thing, artificers can currently only be found amongst the races that were at the forefront of their design. However, because dwarves and gnomes hold particular reverence for it, there are a few paladins of Moradin and Flandal Steelskin who have virtuously chosen to pilot the dangerous artificer technology as both sacrifice and service for their kin and their gods.\n\nArtificers are usually more than simple engineers; beyond their love of their craft, they know how to fight and they use this little-known technology to great advantage, surprising their enemies with the mingled might of fire, electricity and steel.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: None.\n- Race Restriction: Human, Gnome & Dwarf Only.\n- Class Restriction: Unable to multiclass with arcane or divine classes (except select Paladin Orders).\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: Armor (light), Weapons (simple, martial) and Shields (excluding tower shields)\n- Skill Points: 6 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledges, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Handle Trap, Heal, Intimidate, Perform, Search, Sense Motive, Taunt\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Reflex\n- Base Attack Bonus: +3/4 Level\n\nABILITIES:\n\nLevel\n1: Contraptionist I\n2: Inventor's Pursuit [Specialization]\n3: Armor Proficiency [Medium]\n4: Artificer's Focus I\n5: Inventor's Pursuit [Upgrade]\n6: Bonus Artificer feat?\n7: Contraptionist?\n8: Artificer’s Focus II\n9: Armor proficiency [Heavy]\n10: Bonus Artificer feat?\n11: Inventor’s Pursuit Upgrade?\n12: Contraptionist III\n13: Artificer’s Focus III?\n14: Bonus Artificer feat, Experimental Mutagen?\n15: Inventor’s Pursuit Upgrade?\n16: Contraptionist IV?\n17: Bonus Artificer feat?\n18: Grand Invention\n\nContraptionist: The Artificer gains a +1 to Craft Trap and Handle Trap. This becomes +2 at level 7, +3 at level 12 and +4 at level 16.\n\nArtificer's Focus: The Artificer gains 15% increased crafting experience with the Augmenting (previously Enchanting) profession. This becomes 30% at level 8 and 45% at level 13.\n\nInventor’s Pursuit: The Artificer must choose between one of three specializations to pursue, which increases in power as the Artificer gains levels. The choices are as follows:\n\n    Volatile Concoctions: The artificer can throw a volatile mixture of reagents condensed into a bomb. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Artificer level + INT modifier) will half the damage. The bomb deals 3d2 splash damage (1d2 Acid, 1d2 Fire & 1d2 Sonic) at level 1. This becomes 3d6 at level 5, 3d12 at level 11, and 3d12 + 9 at level 15. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes.\n    Capacitor Weapon: The artificer can attach a capacitor to their melee weapon for 3 rounds + 1 round / INT modifier. The capacitor deals 1d4 electrical damage at level 1. This becomes 1d8 at level 5, 1d12 at level 11 and 2d10 at level 15. When this effect ends, the capacitor overcharges and jolts the Artificer for 1d2 electrical damage. The amount of damage taken by the jolt increases to 1d4 at level 5, 1d8 at level 11, and 1d12 at level 15. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes\n    Power Shield: The artificer can ward themself against damage for a short time using a steam-fuelled generator for 3 rounds + 1 round / INT modifier. This damage reduction provided is 5/+1 at level 1. This becomes 10/+1 at level 5, 10/+2 at level 11, and 10/+3 at level 15. When this effect ends, the heat is vented, damaging themselves and all nearby creatures, including allies. The damage dealt is 1d6 fire damage at level 1. This becomes 1d10 at level 5, 2d6 at level 11, and 2d10 at level 15. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes.\n\nArtificer Bonus Feats:\n\n    Forgemaster’s Fury: The artificer becomes especially proficient with light hammers, warhammers, and mauls. While wielding one of these weapons, they gain an additional +3 to their attack rolls and +1 to their damage rolls. Requires level 10.\n    Healing Injector: The artificer gains the ability to use a special device that can heal themselves or an ally for 2d8 plus an additional 5 hit points / INT modifier. This ability may be used six times per day. Requires level 10.\n    Engineer’s Conditioning: The artificer permanently becomes resistant to fire and electricity damage, gaining fire 10/- and electrical 10/-.\n    Static Ward: The artificer attaches a capacitor to his shield, causing attackers to take 1d6 electricity damage each time they strike the artificer. This lasts for 1 round + 1 round / INT modifier. When this effect ends, the capacitor overcharges and jolts the artificer for 1d4 electricity damage. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes.\n    Conductor Bolts: The artificer gains an ability that allows them to fire an extra bolt per round from a light or heavy crossbow. In addition, while this mode is active, any bolt the artificer fires has a 75% chance of additionally applying the effect of the Electric Jolt spell. This ability lasts for 1 round + 2 rounds / INT modifier. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes.\n    Experimental Mutagen: The artificer injects themselves with an experimental mutagen, granting them a +4 bonus to their strength, dexterity, constitution, or intelligence. Duration is 15 minutes per level. This ability may be used three times per day. Only one effect may be active at any given time.\n\nGrand Invention: The artificer can choose their magnum opus from a list of items. Once chosen, the artificer will need to craft this item. The item cannot be traded. Charges associated with any of these items can be restored, and the item does not destroy itself through completely depleted charges. The list is as follows:\n\n    Power Glove (Gauntlet, +3 AC, Cast Spell: Burning Hands [5] 3 Charges/Use, Cast Spell: Lightning Bolt [5] 5 Charges/Use, Cast Spell: Knock [3] 3 Charges/Use)\n    Turbomaul (Maul, +3 Enhancement, +1 Fire Damage, Cast Spell On Hit: Electric Jolt [2], Massive Criticals 1d6)\n    Turbohammer (Warhammer, +3 Enhancement, +1 Fire Damage, Cast Spell On Hit: Electric Jolt [2], Massive Criticals 1d6)\n    Flask Launcher (Heavy Crossbow, +3 AB, Mighty Criticals 1d8, Mighty +2, Cast Spell: Scintillating Sphere 5 Charges/Use, Cast Spell: Fireball 5 Charges/Use)\n    Scryer’s Lens (Amulet, +3 AC, Cast Spell: Identify 3 Uses/Day, Cast Spell: Ultravision 2 Uses/Day, Skill Bonus: Spot +5, Skill Bonus: Search +5)\n    Flash Reflector (Large Shield, +3 AC, On Hit Cast Spell: Daze [5], On Hit Cast Spell: Flare [5], Spell Resistance 10, Light [Dim: White], Skill Bonus: Spot +3)"

      "text": "(PRESTIGE CLASS)\nEmerging out of the chaos of the Longest Year, the palestone knights lead a crusade against magic. With bizarre powers of utterly alien origin, these stern inquisitors have formed a vanguard of their own devising, spearheading an assault on spellcasters across the Realms. Many of these knights band together into orders with a particular philosophy and set of principles, though these ideologies are often so extreme that they clash and spark violence even amongst each other. Other knights seek to war against the Weave entirely alone, even when such a path is fraught with innumerable dangers.\n\nSome of these knights reject the idea of bringing magic into the world personally while accepting the moderate use of arcane or divine aid from others as long as it isn’t misused, while others consider any use of magic to be punishable by death.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: Non-Chaotic, Non-Good only\n- Class Restrictions: Unable to multiclass with arcane or divine classes\n- Hit Die: d10\n- Proficiencies: All simple and martial weapons, all armor and shields (including tower shields)\n- Skill Points: 4 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledge, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, Perception, Perform, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: + 1 Levels\n\n--- Requirements ---\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: +5\n- Knowledge Arcane: 8 Ranks\n- Discipline: 4 Ranks\n- Concentration: 4 Ranks\n- Intimidate: 4 Ranks\n- Feats: Weapon Focus (Melee Weapon), Iron Will, Palestone Initiate\n\nLevel:\n1: Palestone Armor I\n2: Devouring Blade I\n3: Inquisitor\n4: Devouring Blade II\n5: Palestone Armor II\n6: Devouring Blade III\n7: Quieting Sign\n8: Devouring Blade IV\n9: Turning Shield\n10: Palestone Armor III\n\n\nPalestone Initiate: For those wishing to join the ranks of the infamous Palestone Knights, first one must swear to the code that binds their order. This is just the first step on an arduous and secretive path that grants the knights their otherworldly powers. To swear a vow against any and all magic, to combat those who would abuse it, however they might. This is a special feat awarded by an NPC and cannot be taken at character selection or level up.\n\nPalestone Armor: The palestone knight gains the ability to add the material (palestone) property to a set of heavy armor via augmenting/reforging. Any item with this property becomes useable only by palestone knights. While equipped, the palestone knight gains spell resistance 16. The resistance increases to 18 at level 4, 22 at level 7, and 24 at level 10. This effect also grants 33% immunity to magical damage at level 5. This immunity increases to 66% at level 10. Additionally, it grants fire 5/-, cold 5/- and acid 5/- at level 10.\n\nDevouring Blade: The palestone knight can instantly make his next melee attack strip up to four magical effects from an enemy, as the Greater Spell Breach spell. Each effect dispelled by this ability heals the palestone knight for 2d8 + 1d6 / WIS modifier hit points. This attack ignores concealment. Additionally, this ability rips the magic commonly used to bind spellcasters' minions apart, as the Dismissal spell, but affecting all nearby summoned creatures. This ability may be used once every 4 minutes. The cooldown decreases to 3 minutes at level 4, to 2 at level 6, and to 1 at level 8.\n\nInquisitor: The palestone knight gains a +4 bonus to Sense Motive and Intimidate skill checks.\n\nQuieting Sign: The palestone knight creates a zone of impenetrable silence around himself, as the Silence spell, but it cannot be dispelled. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds + 1 round / WIS modifier.\n\nTurning Shield: The palestone knight deflects spells as if they were no better than stray arrows, as the Globe of Invulnerability spell, but it cannot be dispelled. This ability may be used once every 6 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds + 1 round / WIS modifier."

Nearly all of the Order's libraries and monasteries have since succumbed to either the toll of time or The Years of Bonfires in recent memory, with only the Grand Archives persisting to this day in the city of Murann, yet even it wasn't entirely safe from the clutches of Cyricists - or so the rumours go. Nowadays reduced to a less prestigious position, most Quillbearers (as they have come to be known in Amn for their dutiful nature) serve as archivists and scriveners in the Royal Registry with exclusive access to its contents, though the most renowned of the Order's members have been known to attain the title of court scrivener among Amnian mercantile houses, a position of high esteem in Amnian society. Closely associated in many places with the Heralds of Faerûn, members of this order may be asked to carry out tasks for the group of prestigious historians and heralds. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, favored soul and wizards.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is comprised of more than monks, as it can house various worshippers of the two gods, all serving their own purpose in the structure of the Order. Monks specifically tend to focus on lending their bodies to the less physically capable brothers and sisters in both mundane and dangerous matters, primarily protecting the Grand Archives and recovering lost knowledge. They often possess a philosophy of knowledge being tantamount to life itself, believing that permanently lost knowledge is equal to loss of life in its consequences. Monks of the Order see their minds as less vulnerable mobile archives and libraries that must be maintained through the sharpness of mind as well as mental record-keeping, especially in the wake of The Years of Bonfires. The core consists of Amnians, but foreigners may still find a place among the Order. Native to Amn, particularly the city of Murann, the Order offers an established base of sorts for its monks and other members to congregate in and to operate out of."

Since the Time of Troubles and Mystra's faltering power, the loss of magic during the Longest Year, and dead magic areas, the Shining Hand has arisen to a position of some prominence. The Order has started accepting Mystrans and joined the teachings, focusing on the preservation of magic, the elimination of dead magic areas (closely working with Tormtar for this to fulfill their Debt of Destruction), and closer attunement to the distant and fragile Weave to better understand how to restore it. The Shining Hand is the best informed about the state of magic's return on a cosmological scale in the realms. The new integration of Mystran precepts has led some to be enforcers against flagrant use of magic, especially in the current year. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as wizards and sorcerers.\nA small splinter group, still formally of the Shining Hand but causing a Schism, follow extremes of this and support the Amnish Oligarchists, who oppose the greater acceptance of magic in Amn following the Longest Year and Winter of Teeth.

An order of itinerant monks known as the Brotherhood of the Sun served the faithful in the field, bringing the comforting words of Amaunator to the peasants and common folk. Although the Brotherhood of the Sun survived the fall of Netheril and the death of the Yellow God, it never coalesced around a successor to Amaunator. Instead, each monastery chose its own god to serve, with most eventually gravitating to Lathander (god of dawn) or Selûne (goddess of the moon and stars), but a few choosing Sune Firehair.\nToday, the Brotherhood of the Sun is known as the Order of the Sun Soul, and the group's original association with the Church of Amaunator has been largely forgotten. The order now admits both men and women, but retains its itinerant nature and ancestral focus on serving the common folk of the Realms, engaging in charitable work among the poor, sick, and needy. The Order of the Sun Soul maintains a large monastery in the city of Waterdeep, due in large part to the presence of prominent churches of Lathander, Selûne, and Sune. The order's current leader, Monastic Abbot Hanor Kichavo, is attempting to unify the three sects of the order into a cohesive whole for the first time in centuries. Drawing selectively on historical texts that survived the Netherese diaspora and the fall of Calimshan's Cajaan dynasty, he preaches that Lathander, Selûne, and Sune are tripartite fragments of Amaunator, and that the Yellow God shall rise anew once the three are unified to form the one. Hanor has drawn the ire of the churches of Lathander, Selûne, and Sune for his heretical preaching, a feeling echoed by the more traditional members of his order.\n\nNarrative Considerations: Though based in Waterdeep, this order has recently come to Tethyr with the rise of the new monarchy. Righteous Brother Hronkil Elgredsson leads a monastery, Monastery of the Fire Sky in Zazesspur, and Leoske Orsil leads one in Amn, within Lake Khyner, both of which Sun Soul monks of this region can be based in. Righteous Brother Hronkil does not directly preach about the \"tripartite fragments\" prophecy and characters may choose to believe it or not. Sun Soul monks are champions of the people and are required to do charitable work each tenday. Staunch opponents of darkness, evil, and chaos, the Sun Soul monks serve as crusaders against undead and churches of evil deities, defenders of the common folk, and protectors of sites sacred to deities of light and good.\n"

Brimming with confidence in her own abilities, a hin fist transforms that self-assurance into the power of mastery over herself and the world around her. She sees her body and mind as gifts from Yondalla that should be developed and used to the fullest - there should be no need for artificial tools such as weapons. They fought unarmed and their techniques were based around using an opponent's size and strength against them and avoiding blows and taking down those larger than them. They taught other halflings the basics of their style for self-defense, including unarmed combat; this could be recognized as a lesser form of the hin fist style. Hin fists usually study and improve themselves among their own kind in temples in Luiren, however, some enterprising masters established monasteries outside Luiren, and a few opened the order and its teachings to gifted gnome students willing to follow the same path. Otherwise, they wander across the land alone or with small groups, serving as champions of halflings. Their strict beliefs require them to select comrades that are true of heart. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as fighters, rogues, and warsling snipers.\n\nNarrative Considerations: While most commonly found in Luiren, this order has an isolated monastery in the Tejarn Hills north of Hillfort Torbold (once the territory of the short-lived halfling kingdom of Meiritin), led by Fist-Master Fosco Wisestride (halfling) who allows select gnomes into the order. The hills around the monastery are rife with giants and other monstrous humanoids so members of this order can commonly be found wandering the Muranni region combating the efforts of these creatures and monsters."

These monks were largely former and current clergy of the Triadic faiths that had elected to practice more than preach, and contemplate their own lessons in a different way.

They do not hold to the strict moral codes of purification and cleansing which the Disciples of the Phoenix do, yet they are unwilling to commit many of the immoral acts of destruction for the sake of forced renewal that the Disciples of the Salamander have been known to perpetrate. In addition to sharing doctrines with their sibling orders, the Brothers and Sisters of Pure Flame are known to hold feasts, called a Festival of Flame (sometimes in conjunction with the faithful of Malar) with massive bonfires and great spits holding giant animals and creatures. Most of the monks of this order learn Ignan to better communicate with fire elementals. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, favored souls, and Shaman.\n\nNarrative Considerations: The most popular of the three monk orders of Kossuth, members are afforded a wide range of moral leeway in their actions, though, the expectation of self-control and discipline is just as great. Chaos is not tolerated and those who lose control of themselves or their fires are faced with painful discipline or even death. In Amn, the Festivals of Flame are often sponsored by noble houses at great expense where all the food is made free to the guests. The size and rarity of these beasts are often a challenge among the elite to outdo one another, and the church of Malar sees extensive donations for extraordinary catches."

Despite that, some actions can be dramatic, such as destroying a new building, sinking a ship destined for distant unknown lands, or discrediting those trying to become new leaders. Disciples of the Changeless Face also take oaths with extreme seriousness and would never break one upon pain of being cast out of their faith. Anyone else caught as an oathbreaker could face anything from public scolding to physical assault (generally a fistfight and never with intent for serious harm). Monks of this order can multiclass freely as fighters.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is Faerûn-wide and members may come from any region. These monks take note of everything around them and work towards keeping things the way they are, or at best, allowing very slow and methodical change. Opposing change through removing those causing change is acceptable within a neutral moral code but those who do unnecessary evil may likely face discipline. Grumbarryn tend to be large, solid men who want to appear as stable as possible. They're typically calm and stoic, slow to emotional responses, but genuine and honest (except in opportunities of undermining some particular action, in which case dishonesty may be acceptable)."

      "text": "Helm (humans)\n\nThe followers of Helm had more often than not been guards and protectors, from a city's watchmen to professional and dutiful bodyguards. The Grey Gauntlet was a small order splintered off from the newly forming Everwatch Knights, slow to grow within a faith resistant to change and new paths. These monks were dutiful and stern, sworn to perfect service in the protection of a cause, or an individual. Their training was unique within the Helmite orders in that it combined the stalwart defense with an unarmed offense, rather than Helm's hand-and-half chosen weapon. Twinned steel gauntlets and vambraces were able to play host to many defensive and offensive styles, lethal if the monk so chose. Some in this order even preferred the armor they had always been used to, choosing a stalwart defense of steel rather than speed and structure. Shields were, however, forbidden, as both hands were required for the foundational styles of this Order. The Grey Gauntlet and the Everwatch were two orders very closely linked, as their founding had the same intent but with moderately different methods. They have several monasteries in the Vilhon Reach, and one in Darromar. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as divine champions and favored souls.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is generally contained to Tethyr and the Vilhon Reach and members shouldn't come from other places. The Twin Fists of Steel Monastery in Darromar is where those in this region would be based, but monastic duties (which may vary widely) could take them throughout the region for extended periods of time."

      "text": "None (Faithless) (Open to all races)\n\nThe members of this order follow no one religion, instead, they strive for the cosmic balance of all the religions. The order welcomes members of all races and species who are capable of the necessary devotion to the tenents. They do not place the importance of any god over another and only seek to assist or hinder a faith when they feel the balance has been skewed for or against that faith. They believe that each church and its faithful are responsible for supporting a piece of the cosmic balance, including upholding their alliances and actively opposing their enemies. Regional churches or leaders who preach unorthodoxly or create alliances that are heretical to the overall dogma of a god may face the opposition of this order if it threatens to disturb this equilibrium. They preach that all the gods are important and should one faith be disregarded or disposed of the balance will tip; even the vilest of deities serve a purpose because, simply, if they didn't they wouldn't exist. They teach, pragmatically, that everyone should oppose their own god's enemies, but do not hate these enemies for the role they fill. They are simply filling a role the same as you - each is important to the endless cosmic balance.\nSecondary to their preaching and activities towards retaining balance, the order collects for themselves, and erases for others, any written mention or knowledge of the Overgod Ao. Only between themselves do they discuss him and should their philosophy be credited towards Ao, they dismiss the mention of the name as best they're able and claim their tenents are simply obvious based on the gods' portfolios themselves. Ministers of Ao and others who openly preach or speak of him are ignored (as opposing or stopping them would legitimize that Ao is indeed a focus of theirs), though a few unspoken exceptions may arise. Cults claiming to receive spells from Ao, such as one previously in Zazesspur, would be discredited and quietly proven as liars. These monks are allowed to multiclass as wizards to bring more utility and magical knowledge into the order.\n\nNarrative Considerations: Seemingly from nowhere, members of this order suddenly appeared across Toril in 1359DR and began recruiting new members. Few monks make major changes to the area they live in, simply because they're spread fairly evenly across the continents already and the need to move is unnecessary. These monks are outspoken about supporting all the gods and may at times be the first to defend a deity of evil or chaos or their faithful, doing so, logically based on the need of that portfolio to be filled. If a god of torture or assassination dies, another god will just fill its place - as history shows. Though no faith truly fears the order, neither does any faith encourage actively opposing them. If not simply for the uncertainty surrounding them, inciting the order's ire may lead these monks to find a reason to support their enemies to cease that aggression. Additionally, it may draw the attention of those who wouldn't normally be an enemy simply for the fact a faithless neutral 'peacekeeper' was targeted."

      "text": "Loviatar\n\nMonks of the Loviatan faith all belong to the Disciples of the White Rod, named in honor of the token granted to their founder by Loviatar and held in the home abbey near Calimport as a relic. These mystics follow an eccentric philosophy that they call the Way of Transcendence which they do not reveal to others. This philosophy is a commitment to perfecting their bodies and minds against the effects of pain and emotion. Curiously, this is not in the way most people believe. Instead of deadening and dulling the pain, they learn to embrace it. They search out and feel every tiny bit of pain, embracing how it feels, and then controlling their responses to it, with experienced monks learning how to channel it into adrenaline and other beneficial responses - in some cases even pleasure. Emotions are taught to be controlled and set aside, from fear to hate to love all being able to be contained and only used when appropriate. The result of this path are individuals capable of taking inconceivable amounts of pain and mental suffering while still being able to function normally, as well as being able to commit horrendously evil and vile crimes even to those they love the most - or in opposition, hug and compliment a foe they detest with their entire soul. The White Rods prefer using their bare hands to inflict pain rather than using weapons. When forced to use weapons, they prefer nunchaku with white-bleached leather wrappings on the hilts. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, favored souls, and assassins.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order can be found across Faerûn, though more commonly in non-Good places, such as the Moonsea, Calimshan, and Amn. The Black Spires of the Maiden Temple in the Small Teeth Mountains is the largest and most energetic Loviatan temple in the Realms and supports a branch of the White Rods. White Rod monks are generally unemotional, but as part of a plan, they may act in whatever way is necessary. They're extremely thoughtful and while most would probably be comfortable starting fights everywhere they go, the Loviatan dogma states that pain should only be dealt by a disciplined punisher, for unnecessary pain teaches no lesson; unrelenting cruelty will turn folk against the church. So constant and unnecessary fighting would generally be avoided."

They care little for what deity holds the portfolio of death, serving Cyric briefly before Kelemvor, Myrkul before Cyric, and Jergal long before Myrkul. This order of the Long Death dates back to the early days of Calimshan after it was freed from the rule of the genies. It was founded as a means for the slaves of the genies to develop the ability to defend themselves and strike out against their elemental masters, but as time went on the monks became obsessed with killing and death beyond their original purpose. These monks seek to understand death and hope to achieve a perfect death. None are really sure what that means, but they believe that by inflicting pain and death upon others with their bare hands, they gain an understanding of what they need to do to achieve their own perfect deaths. The monks wander the land, accosting people in every part of Faerûn with fist and foot. They have found that pretending to be beggars allows them a great deal of anonymity and freedom to move about. Ironically, many folk mistake them for the Broken Ones (monks of Ilmater), which outrages the worshipers of the Crying Deity.\nMonks of the Long Death normally fight unarmed and preferentially attack humanoid creatures. In situations where they must fight nonhumanoids, they are not averse to using weapons, particularly if their unarmed strikes are not very effective against their foes. They tend to favor the kama in these instances. If they down a foe, they use the remainder of their attacks against that foe to kill, or even use a coup de grace to finish a fallen enemy.\n\nThe monks are opposed by benign deities of life such as Chauntea and Lathander, and are the enemies of the church of Ilmater, which sees their focus on pain and death as being only slightly less repulsive than Loviatar's love of punishment. Kelemvor, the Lord of the Dead, would prefer that they not practice their skills on unwilling targets and encourages his followers to destroy these monks or convince them to fight undead. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as assassins, dread necromancers, and fighters.\n\nNarrative Considerations: Monks of the Long Death can be found all across Faerûn. They're not a highly secretive organization and many adorn their bodies with tattoos or scars of their symbols - images of skulls, often with a black diamond on the forehead. While they were generally distrustful of others, members were civil with those who sought to share any insights about death."

      "text": "Shar\n\nThe Monks of the Dark Moon are a sect of sorcerer-monks who have dedicated themselves body, mind, and soul to Shar, the Lady of Loss. The monks are her assassins, her enforcers, and her shadowy agents. Their training is diverse, as are their skills, and their devotion to their Lady is absolute. They serve the Mistress of the Night by carrying out tasks that she prefers not to assign to her ordinary clergy. In practical terms, the monks of the Dark Moon share the same goal as the church of Shar. Their methods, however, are less obvious and more selective. Whereas the priesthood might be engaged in a long-term plan to topple a city government, the monks might be charged with slipping into that city's chief government building and kidnapping or killing a designated target. The organization's leaders have direct contact with their goddess, and are not subject to the authority or will of her clergy. The Monks of the Dark Moon began in Purskul, and that city is still home to the group's most holy monastery. Amn and the surrounding regions continue to be hotbeds of recruitment for both the Monks of the Dark Moon as well as their Sharran comrades. The monks have since spread across Faerûn, establishing other\nshrines and safe havens wherever they go. The Monks of the Dark Moon take on a new slate of recruits at each monastery every fourteen months. The hopefuls are drawn from those who are already indoctrinated into Shar's mysteries, and even then, only those who show incredible devotion to her ideals are admitted. The rigorous training and vile acts that all recruits must perform weed out most of the order's enemies; the faithful of Shar guard their secrets better than anyone else in Faerûn.\n\nThe first principle is that any new recruit must be a young adult so they're capable of understanding the evil to which they are dedicating their lives. Second, recruits must be among the strongest in their faith, but under no circumstances can they have taken the oath of priesthood. Shar commands that her priests and monks be separate, so both can carry out her will without complication. Finally, recruits must have demonstrated the potential to develop sorcerous abilities. This last was the most stringent requirement that Shar handed down, and many recruits have fallen under the sacrificial knife for lying about such potential. The Monks of the Dark Moon do not accept any member who does not undergo their training, though the training can certainly have been undertaken before a character picks up his first class level.\nThe primary goal of every cell is to bring as many Faerûnians under Shar's influence as possible, so that eventually their dark mistress can win her eternal war against her sister, Selûne. To this end, the worshipers of Shar spread themselves throughout the populated areas of the continent, searching for weak minds into which they can sow thoughts of meaninglessness and revenge. Sometimes a job is too big for one agent to complete, such as the sacking of the temple to Chauntea in Purskul and the assassination of all its priests. Shar does not hesitate to assign the right number of individuals to a job, even if it means combining the forces of her clerics with those of her monks. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as hexblades, shadowdancers, sorcerers, and warlocks.\n\nNarrative Considerations: Amn, Calimshan, Cormanthor and the Moonsea, Sembia, and the Sword Coast are prime recruiting locations for the Dark Moon. Members wouldn't likely be from outside those areas. Sharrans prefer to go about their dark business in secret, with as little interference as possible, and a Monk of the Dark Moon would have a hard time acting in a group that was not made up of others of his order or at least those of the Sharran faith. He might disguise himself and hide his true motives in order to travel less conspicuously, or he might even join the group of someone he was tracking in order to gain an edge when the time came to strike."

Some of these monks rival a Talosian fanatic's love of destructive fire, but most see it as a necessary tool for renewal in the world. Open warfare between this order and the faithful of Istishia, King of Water Elementals, is rampant, though conflict is virtually ensured with the other elemental lords' faithful as well. This order teaches that the controlled destruction through fire provides the cleanest opportunity for renewal. The old, worn, broken, and unworthy should be sacrificed through immolation to provide room for rebirth, new creations, and innovation. However, destruction with fire must be intentional and orderly, requiring discipline, restraint, and self-control otherwise one may lose control to the unpredictable nature of chaos - a grave sin within the order's dogma. Many of these monks bear brands of magical symbols on their bodies and decorate themselves with fiery tattoos. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, favored souls, and Shaman.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This is a Faerûn-wide order and members may come from any region. Disciples of the Salamander often accompany Burning Braziers (the adventuring branch of Kossuth's clergy) seeking out that which is run its course and must be destroyed to allow for replacement by something new, and zealously opposing followers of rival faiths."

      "text": "Yurtrus\n\nCreated in 927DR, by an orc shaman named Wund, this order was established to organize the surviving orcs of the Blood Plagues against the humans of Waterdeep. Through generations, the Brotherhood kept uniting the northern orcs against the humans until 1026DR when the orc kingdom and the Brotherhood, who sustained it, finally suffered a shattering defeat and the orcs of the Sword Mountains disintegrated into warring tribes. This defeat was the catalyst for the order's spread across Faerûn, as all but a few remaining members left the region. Over the next 150 years, branches of this order would appear in all major territories where orcs and humans came into conflict. Through poison and disease, the order eliminates weak or stupid rulers and their supporters allowing those who support war and strength against humans (and the importance of Yurtrus) to find positions of leadership. Despite being some of the most cunning orcs in a tribe, rarely do they directly lead tribes (and never kingdoms) of their own, as that may upset the orcish gods of strength and war, especially Gruumsh. Instead, the Brotherhood leads from behind, quietly eliminating those who stand in the way of war and destruction and thus Yurtus' spread of death and disease to humans and other enemies. Within the past 50 years, some branches of the Brotherhood have begun accepted half-orcs as a way to infiltrate human society for both espionage and assassination. Scarlet Scourge monks bleach their hands white and grow their nails very long. Before combat, they dip their nails in a powder made of blood infected with the red ache, which lets them infect their opponents. Monks of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, favored souls, and blighters.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order can be found throughout Faerûn, however, travel between branches of the order would be uncommon so it's generally best to have your monk come from the Small Teeth region if they're starting in the order. This order also generally works with an orc tribe so a lone, half-orc monk would not be common. For Scarlet Scourge monks in the Murann region, they would be part of the Grave Bone Clan located north of the Ommlur Hills, high in the far western Small Teeth Mountains. The tribal chief is Bromvuk The Mighty, and the leader of this order's branch is Agvokk Spinerot."

Their plots and plans can run for years as they build relationships (even through marriage and kids), learn the languages and habits necessary, and slowly maneuver their way into the position (or positions) which best give them access to what their job entails. At times these jobs may be as vague as general infiltration until they learn something more useful to move after. Their most common role is to provide their church with a means of espionage, though, assassination or theft is not out of the question - these acts, however, are always done in a way that the blame clearly falls on someone else; unsolved murders or random crimes arouse too many suspicions. Secrecy and decretion are of utmost importance and those who learn of the monk's plans are nearly always killed, with someone else left to blame. Monks of this order can multiclass freely assassins, rogues, and swashbucklers.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is Faerûn-wide and especially found within places in opposition to tyranny, such as Cormyr, Waterdeep, and again recently, Tethyr. These monks will do nearly whatever it takes to assume the position necessary to their duties. Their personalities are typically outgoing and they work diligently to fit into the social identity which best gives them an advantage. With the rise of Iyachtu Xvim, the monks are more open to claiming other faiths - and on a rare occasion, and only if required for maintaining their impersonation, praying to another god. However, under Bane, this was an extremely risky act as Bane expected his faithful to submit to only him."

      "text": "None\n\nWhere the nations of Toril's West, up to and including the Sword Coast, were dependant on faith and magic, the Eastern countries had spread their own influence through other ways, without the input of beings divine or arcane. The Path of Enlightenment, the State Religion of much of Kara-Tur, had only ingrained itself deeper into the land and those in contact with it since the Time of Troubles. Its precepts were widely applicable to many even well outside Kara-Tur, and the peaceful faith drew many followers of many nations, with ambassadors of the True Path turning west. With the emphasis on self-reflection and enlightenment came techniques to achieve it, and then harness one's body toward those ends. The True Path spawned an order of monks, often austere but of increasing relevance in the modern-day.\n\nThe size and breadth of this Order allowed for some internal diversity, welcoming as it was. While some sought enlightenment, others sought prowess through it. Others still sought a closer connection to parts of the world that have always been revered, hidden. As reverent as the State was of the True Path and its monks, the order had political use as well, with some of the trainings emphasizing some of the Path's virtues over others. “Be Obedient to Your Lord” often carried greater weight than other virtues, and some of the True Path's monks found true purpose in violent acts, even if they were done dispassionately and honorably.\n\nThe Path of Enlightenment was based on a written code of behavior and beliefs: \"Honor that which has gone before you. For the past is eternal.\" - \"Honor and respect your Elders and the Ancestors. Show honor in word, thought, action, and deed.\" - \"Speak not false words, nor engage in false deeds, for these are not li.\" - \"Do honor to he who rules you, for the Earth is the Mirror of Heaven, and the Son of Heaven is the mirror of the Celestial One. Be obedient to your lord.\" - \"Engage in no base thing, nor commit murder, for to strike another in the name of anger is not li.\" - \"Do honor to those you must rule, for under the eye of Heaven, they are your equals. Be fair to those you rule.\" - \"Know that all things are One under Heaven, even the lowliest of creatures.\" - \"To make strong the force of the Body, to become one with Heaven in defense of the weak and the defenseless - this is truly li.\"\n\n* In these precepts, li was a term meaning \"rightness under heaven\".\n* Nine cardinal virtues were also emphasized by the Path: in alphabetical order, these were Artistry, Compassion, Courage, Fidelity, Honor, Karma, Love, Respect for Tradition, and Scholarship.\n\nNarrative Considerations: This order is from Kara-Turan lands, and outside of Saerloon in Sembia (where a monastery was established in 1363DR) there aren't canon monasteries listed. These would be the best two places for your character to come from and having a thoughtful reason for being so far from a monastery would be ideal. The order allows for a great deal of character flexibility."

      "text": "(PRESTIGE CLASS)\nThe spiraling path of the chymist is embarked upon by those with boundless curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for transcending the frailties of the human condition, drawing in individuals who seek not just to enhance their physical and mental faculties but to redefine them utterly. Their pursuit is marked by a deep dive into the shadowy recesses of alchemical knowledge, where forbidden practices and the manipulation of life's very essence are par for the course. A chymist's journey is self-chosen, propelled by a desire to explore the utmost limits of alchemy and self-enhancement, rather than any preordained destiny or lineage.\n\nChymists subject themselves to extreme regimens of experimental concoctions and transmutative surgeries, willingly becoming their own test subjects in the pursuit of power. They imbibe elixirs so potent and dangerous that they cause drastic and irreversible transformations, turning their bodies into living testaments of their obsession. Their skin, marked by scars and permanently warped, becomes a grotesque canvas showcasing the lengths to which they have gone. While these self-inflicted alterations endow them with remarkable physical abilities, increased resilience, and an aura of almost palpable power, they also render their appearance monstrous, a visible sign of the price they have paid for their ambition.\n\nNOTE: This class is universally treated as undesirable and generally is likely to struggle within the setting of TDN. As such, Chymist isn't recommended as an aspiration for new players or those who shy away from hardship, confrontation, and conflict in storytelling. This class is considered permanently Opt-In as soon as the first level is taken.\n\n- Alignment Restriction: Chaotic Neutral & Any Evil\n- Hit Die: d8\n- Proficiencies: No additional proficiency in any weapon or armor.)\n- Skill Points: 5 + INT Modifier\n- Class Skills: All Knowledges, Barter, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Discipline, Heal, Intimidate, Perform, Sense Motive, Taunt\n- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude & Will\n- Base Attack Bonus: + 1 Levels\n\n--- Requirements ---\n\n- Ability Score: Constitution 14+\n- Feats: Toughness\n- Skills: Concentration 9 ranks, Heal 11 ranks, Knowledge (arcane) 9 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 11 ranks\n\nLevel:\n1: Unsightly Blisters, Unsettling Presence\n2: Choking Gas, Great Constitution\n3: Horrific Tumors, Agonizing Spores\n4: Immolating Wax, Great Constitution\n5: Alchemical Revelation, Great Strength, Great Dexterity\n\n\nUnsightly Blisters: Blisters immediately begin to form on the chymist's skin due to the alchemical mixtures they religiously apply to it. Though soft and painful to the touch, they offer the weathered skin they horrifically adorn a level of resilience against the elements. They gain resistance to acid, cold, electrical, and fire damage, in addition to a bonus to Intimidate skill checks, equal to their class level. However, they suffer a -10 penalty to Barter, Bluff, and Diplomacy checks.\n\nUnsettling Presence: The chymist instantly makes his presence known to all around him, announcing himself with maniacal laughter, the dramatic reveal of the implements of his ‘work’, or an unphased stride of concerning overconfidence. All nearby creatures (both friendly and hostile, other than the chymist) receive a penalty of -2 to their attack rolls and armor class unless they succeed on a Will saving throw against fear. The DC for this ability is 10 + Intimidate skill. This ability may be used once every 3 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds. (Instant cast)\n\nChoking Gas: The chymist recklessly smashes a globe containing a quickly-dissipating, debilitating gas at his feet, apparently uncaring in his vicinity to it. This ability functions as an Cloud of Bewilderment spell centered on the chymist that applies the effect immediately with no persistent cloud left behind. The DC for this ability is 10 + class level + INT modifier. This ability may be used once every 5 minutes.\n\nHorrific Tumors: Through repeated experimentation, the blisters covering the chymist’s skin harden into horrifying tumors, acquiring a toughness akin to bone. They gain protection against physical attacks in addition to their elemental resistance, providing a +1 natural bonus to armor class.\n\nAgonizing Spores: The chymist instantly reaches into his haversack and gleefully spreads a handful of what appears to be brown dust into the air. Though harmless at first, the dust is ground from fungal spores which cause intense pain when introduced to open wounds. As a result, all nearby creatures (both friendly and hostile, including the chymist) deal additional damage, as the Acid Weapon spell. This ability may be used once every 5 minutes. Duration is 3 rounds. (Instant cast)\n\nImmolating Wax: The chymist pauses for a moment to quickly, and haphazardly, lather his body in a thick, foul-smelling compound. The odd wax mires incoming blows, granting the chymist 1d6 temporary hit points per class level for 1 minute, but that is not its primary function. With a little assistance from sparks generated by his opponent’s weaponry or, at a push, his own, the substance violently explodes in flame after 1 round, as a Fireball-like explosion of 7d6 damage, centered on himself. The DC for this ability is 10 + class level + INT modifier. This ability may be used once every 5 minutes.\n\nAlchemical Revelation: With a sinister grin or a wild cackle, the chymist hastily prepares and tosses a satchel of his remaining unstable admixtures to a position of his choice. The satchel remains active for 5 rounds before becoming inert. If the satchel is successfully struck by acid, cold, electrical, or fire damage, it starts a grand chemical reaction followed by a massive explosion of scintillating colors and widespread destruction. Nearby creatures (both friendly and hostile, including the chymist) suffer 3d6 acid, 3d6 cold, 3d6 electrical and 3d6 fire damage. Additionally, for each element that deals damage to a creature, they must succeed on a saving throw or additionally suffer the listed effect (the DC for these saves is 10 + class level + INT modifier):\nAcid: -1 penalty to attack bonus. Duration is 3 rounds. Fortitude save.\nCold: Movement speed is reduced by 30%. Duration is 3 rounds. Reflex save.\nElectrical: The affected creature becomes stunned. Duration is 2 rounds. Fortitude save.\nFire: -1 penalty to armor class. Duration is 3 rounds. Reflex save.\nThis ability may be used once per day. "

Players can no longer target others with this skill, instead, players must roll a Sleight of Hand VS an opposing player's Spot check and react according to what the scenario would dictate.\n\n    A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.\n    When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer’s Spot check. The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.\n    You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it’s generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.\n\nMechanical Rework:\n\n    Sleight of Hand (previously Pick Pocket) has been reworked to focus entirely on silver (previously gold) theft from the target. (Sleight of Hand vs Target's Spot). d20 + Sleight of Hand vs d20 + Spot.\n\n\n    Possible silver amount to steal: 3d20.\n    Will not work on targets with less than 50 silver, or those that are not humanoid/civilized (no orcs/goblins/etc).\n    User can only use Sleight of Hand once per hour to perform a pick-pocket.\n    Targets (Other Players) can only be pick-pocketed once a day, or once per reset TOTAL. Whichever comes first.\n        To clarify: A player can only lose silver via pick-pocket once per 24 hour period, or once per reset.\n    NPCs can be stolen from, however will turn hostile and attack if the Pickpocket fails.\n    If the User fails against a PC, a small VFX will play for the target on the location of the pickpocket, and they will be notified of the attempt.\n    If the User succeeds against the target, the PC will take the gold from the target. A notification will be sent to the target after 4d6 Rounds to let them know some coin was stolen.\n"

Maintaining this spell's effects requires the caster's concentration and, should their concentration be disrupted or they attempt to cast another spell, the effect immediately ends. Upon casting this spell, the caster may select one of the following effects (only one effect may be maintained at a time.):\n\n    Spark: A tiny, flickering flame forms from the end of the caster's fingertip. The flame does not burn the caster and is far too tiny to bring harm to another creature. It is sufficient, however, to slowly warm a cup of liquid, light a candle, torch, or kindle a small fire given the right materials. If a fire occurs, it will continue to burn after the flame naturally dwindles on the spell's duration expires; suitable environmental conditions pertaining.\n    Cool/Warm: This spell can, to a limited degree, slowly cool or heat areas of non-magical surfaces, objects, and creatures with a touch - but if such a target is too hot or cold for the caster to comfortably touch, they may be harmed in the attempt. After this spell's duration expires, or the caster stops touching the target, if its natural state is warmer or cooler than the caster has forced it to become, it will quickly return to that state.\n    Magnify: By touching an object or creature, the caster can magnify its appearance to up to twice its size, but only to them. This effect lasts until its duration expires.\n    Clean: With a touch, the caster begins to clean a small, non-magical object of dirt and muck. This effect is permanent, effectively lasting until the object becomes dirty again.\n    Shine: The caster can cause a small, non-magical object they touch to gleam as if polished. This effect is permanent; at least until the object loses its shine again.\n    Mend: The caster may mend a single minor break, bend, or tear in a small, non-magical object with a touch, such as a torn piece of clothing or a bent key. This effect is permanent.\n"

For information about aspects of the skill that have not been changed, please reference Use Magic Device on the NWN Wiki.\n\nCheck: The following part pertaining to overcoming class, race and alignment restrictions on items is unchanged from vanilla NWN:\nThe base difficulty class (DC) of this task is determined by the value of the item, and modified by the type of emulation the character is attempting.

Emulating a specific class does not modify the base DC.\n\nAll parts of the skill pertaining to using wands and scrolls have been customized on TDN, and use the flat DCs specified below.

They are often chained together and placed in front of field  fortifications, thus stopping the advance of the enemy.

Of course chevaux de frise could be destroyed, just like any other wooden obstacle, by artillery."

The triangle also supports the axle, making it easier to build the axle assembly rigid. Movement here can have a large effect on the side-to-side accuracy of the machine. The major disadvantages are that the pullers all reach the point where their efforts have no effect (when their ropes are in line with the beam) at the same time, after which the beam is coasting.

Once the chamber is deemed to be sufficiently large, the combustible material is set on fire and the miners withdraw. The supporting props eventually burn through and the wall collapses into the chamber. Once a mine is begun, the only defense against it is ounter-mining; i.e. the defenders dig their own tunnel hoping to break in to that of the besiegers and halt its construction or try to flood it. Of course, a good moat can prevent mining altogether."

When the lever is lowered the pocket of the  sling can be armed with a large stone ball or even several stones. The chief of operation gives the signal, the lever is released and  a group of gunners are suspended on the cords and accelerate the  upswing of the sling. The aiming process is rather long and one  must often carry out many tests. This machine can launch a heavy  projectile of about 100Kg only every approximately two hours, but  as soon as the calibration is finished the damage caused to fortifications is considerable. The projectile can reach a distance  of up to 150 meters. The Rather complicated nature of the reloading mechanism and the  enormous counterweight, produce a great deal of stress on the  frame, this in turn, massively reduces the life span of the mechanism."

In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.\n\nWritten material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text."
